faculty\\n\\nboarded a bus outside the university’s\\n\\nschool of public health. the destination\\n— detroit.\\n\\nhowever, this group wasn’t going to visit the\\ntourist hotspots. while eastern market and the\\nrenaissance center were on the itinerary, these\\nparticipants had signed up to see some of the\\nmost polluted and industrialized areas of the\\ncity, hear about the historic factors that brought\\nthe city to its current state and to learn about\\nthe public health concerns for residents in these\\nareas.\\n\\n“detroit’s a challenging place — it’s an inter-\\nesting place,” said sociology prof. reynolds far-\\nley, one of the trip leaders for the 2014 tour of\\ntoxic sites, sponsored by the university’s center\\nfor occupational health and safety engineering.\\n\\nfor better or worse, the city has for decades\\nbeen used as a case study for some of society’s\\nmost serious economic and social concerns.\\nfrom the collapse of the auto industry to the his-\\ntory of racial tensions, academics use detroit as a\\nmodel for other similar u.s. cities.\\n\\nthe annual tour seeks to provide future pub-\\nlic health and social justice workers with a first-\\nhand look at contemporary issues, reflecting\\nthe university’s growing involvement — both\\nacademically and socially — in the city in recent\\nyears.\\n\\nas the bus and its 30 to 40 passengers left ann\\narbor, farley began discussing the impact of the\\ncity’s history on the current environmental con-\\ncerns.\\n\\nthe rise of an industrial giant\\n\\nfounded as a trading post in the early 16th\\ncentury, detroit saw significant population and\\nindustrial growth starting in 1855 with the com-\\npletion of two major projects — a railroad con-\\nnecting the city to new york and chicago and\\nthe completion of the locks at sault ste. marie,\\nputting detroit in the position to utilize michi-\\ngan’s industrial resources — white pine, iron ore\\nand copper — to become an industrial power-\\nhouse.\\n\\nthe civil war spurred demand for such\\nindustrial products, and the city grew from a\\npopulation of 21,000 in 1850 to almost 300,000\\nby 1900.\\n\\nthe industrial boom marked the start of\\nmajor pollution problems in the city and region.\\nlong before the era of government regula-\\ntion and oversight, manufacturers often simply\\ndumped industrial waste into the detroit river\\nor let it soak into the ground around the plants\\nthat produced them. some of those toxic effects\\ncan still be felt today.\\n\\nbut any industrial ‘boom’ of the 19th century\\npales in comparison with the growth of industry\\nin the early 20th century as detroit gave birth to\\nthe u.s. auto industry. the ‘big 3’ automakers —\\nford, general motors, and chrysler — all set up\\nshop in the city.\\n\\nin 1917, ford motor co. began construction\\non its river rouge complex, the single larg-\\nest industrial complex in the world at the time.\\nat its height, it employed more than 100,000\\nworkers and still operates in a limited capac-\\nity today, though it was sold by the ford family\\nand has been downsized due to environmental\\nrestrictions. the company now operates several\\nmodern plants in the surrounding area and in\\n\\nlearin\\n\\ndearborn. according to the sierra club, a nation-\\nal environmental preservation group founded\\nin 1892, these plants produced over 600,000\\npounds of toxic pollutants in 2010, contributing\\nthe “largest burden of environmental pollution”\\nin detroit.\\n\\ngeneral motors opened a cadillac assembly\\nplant near mexicantown in 1921 and later relo-\\ncated to their detroit/hamtramck assembly\\nfacility north of the city in 1985. the company\\npurchased the iconic waterfront renaissance\\ncenter in 1996 to serve as its world headquarters.\\naccording to the sierra club, the hamtramck\\nfacility produced over 180,000 pounds of toxic\\nreleases and over 240,000 pounds of other waste\\nin 2010.\\n\\nfarley noted that recognizing the city’s his-\\ntory is vital to understanding its continuing\\nstruggles.\\n\\n“people don’t spend a whole lot of time think-\\ning about cities and how the history of cities,\\nwhen homes were built and factories were built,\\nhow that influences the present,” farley said.\\n“but, they’re open to thinking about it; they seem\\nto be interested.”\\n\\nthe grassroots movement\\n\\nafter a brief tour of downtown and lunch at\\neastern market, students and faculty boarded\\nthe toxic tour bus for the main event — a look\\nat some of the most polluted and industrialized\\nareas of the city.\\n\\ncharles stokes works for detroiters work-\\ning for environmental justice, an organization\\npartnered with the university’s school of public\\nhealth, and joined the bus tours to provide stu-\\n\\ndents with context from a local resident’s per-\\nspective.\\n\\nstokes highlighted the pollution in detroit as\\nan environmental justice issue. in his position,\\nhe works as an organizer spreading the word\\nto afflicted neighborhoods about the dangers of\\nvarious toxic sites and unite people to pressure\\nthe city to make changes.\\n\\namong the many locations on the tour’s itin-\\nerary were the rouge steel plant, the marathon\\noil refinery, and the waste treatment plant.\\nstokes explained how these locations contribute\\nto carbon dioxide levels and other forms of air\\npollution, as well as producing harmful indus-\\ntrial byproducts, such as petroleum coke, during\\nthe process of refining raw tar sands — mostly\\nimported from alberta, canada — into oil.\\n\\nthe tour also visited the detroit municipal\\nwaste incinerator, a contentious topic in the\\ncity for years and known for its infamous smell.\\nstokes organized area residents to continu-\\nally file odor complaints against the incinerator\\nbased on reports that the smell has caused peo-\\nple to feel nauseous and, in some cases, become\\nmore seriously ill.\\n\\nopened in 1986, the waste incinerator is the\\nlargest of its kind in the u.s., accommodating\\nover 3,000 tons of garbage ona daily basis. along\\nwith the long-standing debate over the plant’s\\nodor, the facility also emits airborne substances,\\nsuch as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and car-\\nbon monoxide, which have created public health\\nconcerns in the community.\\n\\nafter the actions taken by residents and envi-\\nronmental groups, michigan’s department of\\nenvironmental quality brought suit against the\\nprivate company that now owns the incinerator.\\nin the past two weeks, the city passed a consent\\nagreement mandating the operators update the\\nincinerator’s air ducts to reduce the odor within\\ntwo years or face a fine.\\n\\nwhile the proceedings demonstrated the\\nability of community groups to help rectify envi-\\nronmental injustice in the city, the incinerator\\nis only one of many such facilities that are wor-\\nrisome to residents. stokes said there is still\\nplenty of work to be done, but that he is proud so\\n\\nfar with the progress. additionally, he said\\n\\neducating university students is a key\\n\\npart of ensuring solutions for the\\nfuture.\\n\\n“we stand on the shoulders\\n\\nof those who came before us\\n\\nand so i offer my shoulders\\n\\nfor those who would like\\n\\nto stand on them,” he said.\\n\\n“when you have the ear of\\n\\na bunch of ‘world-changers,’\\n\\nwhat i mean is those students,\\n\\ntheir future’s not defined yet\\n\\nand so we’re going to help instill\\n\\nsomething that is based in justice\\n\\nequality and participation of all peoples.”\\nenvironmental injustice\\n\\nhistorically, industry and residential areas\\nof detroit were built in close proximity to one\\nanother, as this made the most sense for work-\\ners who needed to commute. despite a modern\\nunderstanding of the environmental concerns\\ntoday, farley said it can be difficult both politi-\\ncally and financially to relocate people away\\nfrom pollution sites.\\n\\ninstead, residents and grassroots organizers\\nare working to have industry more strictly regu-\\nlated. so far, the results are mixed, as facilities\\nsuch as the marathon refinery have pledged to\\nreduce emissions, while at the same time con-\\ntinuing to increase their facility’s output.\\n\\naccording to a report from the detroit alli-\\nance for asthma awareness, rates of asthma in\\nthe city are three times the national average.\\nsome have argued that michigan’s department\\nof environmental quality and the u.s. environ-\\nmental protection agency could be doing more\\nto regulate industries.\\n\\nfurthermore, the sierra club contends that\\nthe environmental impacts are not evenly dis-\\ntributed among the state’s population. citing\\nresearch from natural resources prof. paul\\nmohai, the report indicates that over 80 percent\\nof african-american students attend school in\\nthe top decile of polluted areas in the state, as\\nopposed to 44 percent of white students.\\n\\nat the start of the auto boom in the 1920s,\\ndetroit’s population was over 95 percent white.\\nthe middle class thrived under the plethora of\\nskilled manufacturing jobs. by the end of the\\n20th century, however, the demographics had\\nundergone a massive shift. in 2010, blacks made\\nup over 82 percent of residents.\\n\\nwhile middle-class workers had the ability to\\nmove to the suburbs or leave the city entirely, less\\nadvantaged groups were left to deal with the fall-\\nout of years of environmental degradation.\\n\\n“there were no incentives to cooperate on\\nmajor issues, like economic development, trans-\\n\\nportation, education, or environmental protec-\\ntion,” farley said. “the suburban communities\\nwent their own way and competed with the city\\nand ... city-suburban disputes often turned into\\nnasty black-white disputes.”\\n\\nin 2013, sierra club detroit referred to the\\nenvironmental pollution in the city as a “human\\nrights abuse” and “environmental injustice.”\\ngrassroots organizations, such as detroiters\\nworking for environmental justice, have taken\\non initiatives to improve underprivileged com-\\nmunities.\\n\\n“given the contamination of their immediate\\nenvironments, these communities have inordi-\\nnately high levels\\n\\ntal justice in det\\n\\nfnior news editors\\n[llingham & will greenberg\\n\\nof asthma, cancer, neu-\\nrological disorders and\\nbirth defects,” the sierra\\nclub report stated.\\ndelray resident forest\\nhudson acknowledged that\\npollution is a major concern\\nin his area.\\n\\n“the area’s a dump, but i love it,” hudson\\nsaid. “i know there’s a lot of toxic waste.”\\n\\nat the community center where he works,\\nlines of smokestacks surround the soccer fields\\nwhere children come for after-school activities.\\nthe air smells of sulfur and garbage.\\n\\n“tt’s just background,” hudson said, referenc-\\ning the close proximity of the industry.\\n\\nbut he said people in\\nthe community are fighting\\nback, despite a seeming lack\\nof involvement from city\\nofficials. as hudson puts\\nit, people are “fighting for\\ntheir livelihood” and there\\nis an increasing effort to\\nhold government officials\\naccountable in remedying\\nthe concerns.\\n\\nin addition to industry,\\ndelray lies in the midst of\\nmajor trucking and ship-\\nping routes near the uss.\\nterminal for the ambas-\\nsador bridge, a major thor-\\noughfare of u.s.-canadian\\neconomic trade. as many\\nas 9,000 trucks pass these\\ncheckpoints each day.\\n\\nthe city has passed\\nanti-idling laws to pro-\\nhibit trucks waiting near\\nthe bridge terminals from\\ncontaminating surround-\\ning neighborhoods with air\\npollution, but these laws are\\nrarely enforced by police.\\nin addition, reports indi-\\ncate that the approach to\\nthe ambassador bridge is |\\nplagued by delays.\\n\\nnow, there are plans to |\\nexpand such operations by\\nopening a new bridge by\\n2020 to accommodate larg-\\n\\n/\\n\\n7\\n\\nthe toxic tour\\n\\nford plant |\\n\\na l\\noakwood heights\\n\\nmarathon refinery\\n\\ner trade volume. while these expansions seek to\\nincrease the flow of traffic along one of the most\\nimportant international trade rates, hudson’s\\nhouse sits on land needed to build the u.s. cus-\\ntoms plaza.\\n\\nhe said the city plans to buy his house next\\nyear. motioning to an image on the wall of the\\ncommunity center, he said there were originally\\nplans to build a community for the displaced\\nresidents, but those plans fell through — the area\\nproposed for housing was deemed more appro-\\npriate for expanding industry.\\n\\nas for his community, hudson said he’s\\nunsure if their efforts to garner aid from the city\\nwill yield results.\\n\\n“tt’s only a mat-\\nter of time before\\nwe know one way\\n\\nor another whether\\nthey take our con-\\ncerns seriously,” he said.\\n\\nneighborhood negotiations\\n\\nit’s no secret that detroit made its mark as an\\nindustrial giant, and with industry comes pol-\\nlution. however, as detroiters argue, pollution\\nin the city is no longer simply an environmental\\nconcern, but a social disparity as well.\\n\\nthe city’s population has shrunk from nearly\\ntwo million at its height in the 1950s to about\\n700,000 today. those that remain do so for a\\nvariety of reasons — some feel loyal to the city\\nwhile others lack the resources to move else-\\nwhere. regardless, the shifting demographics\\nmean that those responsible for creating a toxic\\n\\nenvironment are not the ones suffering from its\\neffects.\\n\\nthe collapse of the auto industry and subse-\\nquent municipal bankruptcy have resulted in the\\ndownsizing or closure of some of detroit’s most\\niconic facilities — such as ford’s river rouge\\nplant — which are replaced with newer, decen-\\ntralized production models. at the new ford\\ncomplex, environmental efforts are underway\\nto limit emissions and protect water sources.\\nthe new facility boasts one of the largest “living\\nroofs” in the world, using natural grasses and\\nplants to reduce the plant’s energy consumption\\n— a promising effort toward increasing environ-\\nmentally minded industry around the city.\\n\\nother companies have developed their own\\nstrategies for dealing with increasing environ-\\nmental regulation.\\n\\nin oakwood heights, a few residents are\\nholding out against marathon petroleum co.,\\nwhich has bought homes from over 300 residents\\n— paying an average of $65,000 per home — as\\npart of a plant expansion effort. by removing\\nresidents, the company can effectively increase\\nits distance from residential areas, bypassing\\ncertain restrictions based around proximity to\\nhomes.\\n\\nby simply refusing to sell their homes, these\\nresidents have been thrust into the middle of a\\ndebate that will likely continue for years to come.\\nand, in a city that has historically faced some\\nof the most impactful racial conflicts of mod-\\nern uss. history, the next chapter of such debate\\nmay not come in the form of protest and politi-\\ncal uprising, but in the billows of smoke that have\\nlong symbolized detroit’s industrial might.\\n\\nce.\\n\\nx ambassador bridge\\n\\ndelray\\n\\\\\\n\\nzug

       " 'a-11.png': {'text': '| 6b | wednesday, november 5, 2014 // the statement\\n\\ndo u.s. colleges have something to learn from german tuition policy?\\nby rachel premack\\n\\nen german universities began\\n\\ncharging tuition in 2006, the back-\\n\\nlash was swift. at the university of\\n\\nfreiburg, where university of michigan his-\\n\\ntory department chair kathleen canning\\n\\nwas administering a study abroad program in\\n\\nthe 2000s, students occupied classrooms and\\n\\nhung enormous banners that read, “education\\nis a human right.”\\n\\nthe fees that caused the outrage? an aver-\\nage of $630 per semester. at this university,\\nin-state lsa students pay $6,579 and out-\\nof-staters pay $20,789.\\n\\n“it didn’t matter how much it was,”\\ncanning said. “it didn’t matter that it was\\naffordable for most middle-class fami-\\nlies. it was the principal of introducing\\ntuition.”\\n\\nlucky for the students, the final ger-\\nman federal state abolished tuition in\\noctober. now anyone — german citizen\\nor not — can receive a free college educa-\\ntion at one of germany’s globally lauded\\nuniversities.\\n\\npast german college students are now\\namong world-renowned philosophers,\\nresearchers, entrepreneurs, writers and\\nleaders. the nation is the world’s third-\\nlargest importer and exporter. more\\nnobel laureates are from germany than\\nany other nationality — save for the u.s.\\nand u.k.\\n\\nso why don’t these students have to\\npay the thousands of dollars per year that\\namericans do?\\n\\ntuition in the united states has not\\nalways been so high. at the university, adjust-\\ning for inflation, in-state students paid $1,472\\nin the 1969-1970 academic year. it rose, by\\ndecade, to $1,970 in 1980, $3,065 in 1990 and\\n$5,704 by 2000.\\n\\njust as well, until the mid-20th century,\\nhigher education was something attainable\\nonly by the most elite social classes in ger-\\nmany.\\n\\n“the whole notion of buildings, education,\\nwas a fundamental attribute of the bourgeoi-\\nsie and the nobility,” canning said. “it was not\\nsomething that anyone in the middle class or\\nlower middle class could aspire to.”\\n\\nuniversity education remains somewhat\\nexclusive in germany, though its hierarchical\\nsystem is becoming easier to enter. in elemen-\\ntary school, children take an exam that divides\\nthem into one of three schools: gymnasium;\\nrealschule or hauptschule. only gymnasium is\\nauniversity-preparatory school.\\n\\ngymnasium has become more accessible\\nover the past few decades. according to ger-\\nman data portal statista, 15 percent of students\\nin 1952 were in gymnasium. by 2005, it was 33\\npercent.\\n\\nthe increasingly open doors of the gym-\\nnasium have caused a strain on universities\\nthe past decade and a half, canning said. pro-\\nfessorships are few. in the frieburg history\\ndepartment, for instance, canning said there\\n\\nwere nine history professors. the university\\nof michigan has 90.\\n\\n“there’s a second tier of what they call\\nmid-career instructors who, however, have no\\njob security and they’re not even permanent\\nlecturers like you would have here,” canning\\nadded. “they’re often filling in or actually\\nteaching for free while hoping to get a profes-\\nsorship somewhere else.”\\n\\njohannes von moltke, associate profes-\\nsor and chair of german, said, “there’s over-\\n\\ncrowding in german universities. because it’s\\nreally accessible, a lot of people study.”\\n\\nrackham student cristian capotescu\\nreceived his history degree from the univer-\\nsity of freiburg in 2010. lectures are not so\\ndifferent in german schools than in the u.s.,\\ncapotescu described, with packed lecture\\nhalls of hundreds of students.\\n\\nwhere differences existed were in semi-\\nnars and tutorials, the latter being something\\nlike a class section with a greater emphasis on\\nlearning how to better write, read, etc. capo-\\ntescu said graduate students often teach semi-\\nnars, whereas here professors almost always\\nlead them. stranger yet, undergraduates are\\nwont to teach these tutorials.\\n\\n“the quality of those sections are a lot\\nlower,” capotescu said. “i certainly think\\ngraduate students are more qualified to teach\\nthose sections, but is it worth $40,000 a year?”\\n\\nthe ban on tuition in germany was lifted in\\n2006. following that, various german states\\nbegan issuing small semester fees to better its\\nquality of education. canning said the hugely\\nunpopular tuition actually did not help condi-\\ntions at university.\\n\\n“either they just conceded that it wasn’t\\nenough money to really do anything and it was\\ntoo controversial to even bother with it,” can-\\nning said.\\n\\ncapotescu agreed that 500 euros ($624.95)\\n\\nper semester was unlikely to break the bank;\\nhowever, the implementation of tuition on\\nprinciple could later prove difficult.\\n\\n“there’s always the possibility that it could\\nbe increased,” capotescu said. “we saw that\\nin the u.s. that once higher tuition was intro-\\nduced it kept increasing.”\\n\\nin 2012, the average debt of a university\\ngraduate was nearly $28,000, with 44 per-\\ncent of the student body graduating with debt.\\nmoreover, while the german government\\n\\nluna anna archey/daily\\ncontinues invest money in education, a mere 16\\npercent of the university’s budget come from\\nstate appropriations.\\n\\n“the money we need grows and the money\\nwe get shrinks,” von moltke said.\\n\\nas recently as 1990, state funding and\\ntuition contributed equally to the budget.\\n\\ncapotescu noted issues with a huge student\\nbody, not unlike germany.\\n\\n“we assume that with american educa-\\ntion, you pay so much so it’s better. when you\\nlook closer at elite public higher education at\\nschools like michigan, it’s not a perfect world\\nor utopia,” capotescu said. “you still have 150\\nstudents ina lecture.”\\n\\nthe increased tuition did encourage a state\\nof mind that does not exist in germany. amer-\\nican college students view themselves as con-\\nsumers at the university; we spend a certain\\namount of money and expect a certain qual-\\nity of service. german collegiates, though, are\\n“student-citizens,” von moltke explained.\\n\\nfor instance, career advising is more or less\\nnon-existent in germany. students can use\\ngovernment offices for these things. in fact,\\nmost services like housing and public trans-\\nportation for students are provided by the city\\nor state.\\n\\n“its job is to serve the public, not to treat its\\nstudents as clients,” von moltke said. “for bet-\\nter and for worse, in the u.s., you are a paying\\n\\nclient and because of the way american capi-\\ntalism works, customer service is part of the\\nexperience... of course it kind of commodifies\\neducation. it becomes a good to be exchanged\\nbetween a seller and buyer. whereas in ger-\\nmany, the ideal is still it’s a public good so\\nyou’re not paying or buying for it, you’re taking\\nadvantage of your right to education. but then\\nit isn’t kind of fenced in with all of these con-\\nsumer bells and whistles.”\\n\\nthat lack-of-consumer model is also\\nreflected in the type of education students can\\n\\nexpect. canning described three types of\\nclasses: lectures and small, introductory and\\nadvanced seminars.\\n\\na first-year student in an introductory\\nseminar on the french revolution, canning\\ndescribed, would be expected to already\\nknow the chronology of the revolution, or\\nreceive suggestions for background reading.\\nthe course would focus on reading primary\\nsources — in french — and discussing them.\\n\\nstudents in lecture courses rarely have\\nperformance-based measurements, like\\nquizzes or tests, at the end. instead, stu-\\ndents ask to take an oral exam with a profes-\\nsor if they feel they know the material well\\nenough.\\n\\n“if you bomb, it’s your own fault and no\\none cares,” canning said. “there’s nobody\\nthere to hold your hand. it’s up to you. you’re\\na scholar, you’re at the university because\\nyou want to actually learn. our little ‘holding\\nout the carrot’ just doesn’t happen.”\\n\\nlsa junior alexandra trecha, who is\\nstudying in

we shared our deepest\\nsecrets and fears and dreams with\\neach other and never, ever ran out of\\nthings to talk about. in this friend-\\nship, i found a deeper level of emo-\\ntional intimacy than anything i had\\never shared with another person. she\\nwas the best friend that i’d ever had.\\n\\nwith all the similarities that\\nallowed us to become such close\\nfriends, we were also incredibly dif-\\nferent. she was outgoing, where i\\nwas reserved; she loved taking pho-\\ntographs, i loved to write. she was\\nconfident and sure of herself while i\\nworried too much about what others\\nthought of me. ultimately, the news-\\npaper gave me this relationship. we\\nbonded over the ridiculous amounts\\nof time we devoted to our publica-\\ntions. the school yearbook contin-\\nued to win awards, while the school\\nnewspaper struggled to stay alive.\\nregardless, we both did a lot of our\\ngrowing up ina computer lab.\\n\\nwe kissed for the first time while\\nwe were watching a documentary on\\nseptember 11. by this point, i was fill-\\ning out college applications and had\\nbeen promoted to editor in chief of\\nthe now-monthly newspaper. she\\nwas a freshman in college and had\\nmoved several hours from home. it\\nseemed like everything had changed\\nsince i was a sophomore, but our\\nfriendship endured it all.\\n\\nby carolyn gearig\\n\\ni'll never forget that moment. to\\nthis day, i don’t know who started it.\\nwhat i do know is that i enjoyed it,\\nit was completely unexpected and it\\nhit me straight in the head with no\\nwarning.\\n\\nthe following week was perhaps\\nthe scariest time of my life. i had no\\nidea what was happening: my world\\nwas turned upside down. one week i\\nconsidered myself to be straight and\\nher to be my best friend; the next,\\neverything was different. the idea\\nof my friendship changing scared me\\nshitless. she was the only one i want-\\ned to talk to, yet she was the root of\\nmy insecurities.\\n\\nso began the coming out pro-\\ncess: something i still can’t stand. i\\nhave never been ashamed or embar-\\nrassed of my sexuality — whatever\\nit is — but i hate the act of telling. i\\nfeel like it is oftentimes similar to the\\nfact that i have always worn glasses:\\nsomething that is important to me, in\\nsome ways, but mostly just a part of\\nwho i am. i hate coming out because\\nit makes me feel so vulnerable: what\\nis to most people an afterthought is,\\nto me, deeply personal. at the time, i\\nhad no idea how to define my sexuali-\\nty, unwilling to classify it as anything\\nother than “not straight.” i hated\\nit, because i felt like i had to define\\nit, though i wasn’t sure what that\\ndefinition was. i hated it, because of\\nmy friends never had to come out as\\nstraight. coming out to each person\\npresented a unique, complicated bat-\\ntle with myself.\\n\\nafter a lot of discussion and deep\\nthinking, we decided to make our\\nrelationship official, but i had no\\none to share the happy news with.\\ninstead, we started together on a\\npath to self-discovery. i realized\\nmore and more, as every minute went\\nby, how strongly i had felt towards\\nher. though i previously had crushes\\non boys, it was nothing compared to\\nthe way i felt when she walked into a\\nroom. everything i had ever done, i\\nwanted to do with her.\\n\\nour relationship didn’t survive\\nmy senior year of high school, but\\nsometimes i wonder if she would\\nstill be in my life had we been in a\\nboy-girl relationship. the pressures\\nthat came from falling in love while\\nkeeping it a secret and coming to\\nterms with my own sexuality were\\nimmense. this put pressures on our\\nrelationship that no one should have\\nto face. and being several hours\\napart only made it that much worse.\\n\\nlooking back, all the signs were\\nthere. we were close in a way i had\\nnever been with any of my friends.\\nbut i had always identified as\\nstraight. coming to terms with this\\nchange in my identity was a process\\ni still struggle with day in and day\\nout. i have learned that sexuality is\\na spectrum and is not as black and\\nwhite as i previously thought.\\n\\nluckily, i had several people\\nwho stood by me throughout the\\nordeal, and for that i cannot thank\\nthem enough. i am blessed with\\nopen-minded friends and family who\\n\\ngnvtiohtinw nvoaw ad noilvalsntii\\n\\naccepted and loved me for who i am.\\nwithout these people, i don’t know\\nhow i would have made it through.\\nfor those who i didn’t tell until after\\nthe fact, i was sorry. trust me when\\ni say that keeping it a secret wasn’t\\nwhat i wanted.\\n\\nultimately, am i glad it hap-\\npened? our four months of happiness\\nmeant more than i can say, but losing\\nher as a friend because of it was sad-\\nder than i can possibly describe. but\\nin the process, i learned an incredible\\namount about who i was and what i\\nwanted from the rest of my life.\\n\\nnow, i work 20 hours a week\\nfor a newspaper with a legitimate\\nbudget and a circulation of 15,000.\\ni’m dating a boy. my high school\\nself wouldn’t recognize me now. i’m\\nhappier than i’ve ever been but i am\\noften reminded of how much easier\\nmy second relationship is over the\\nfirst. i’ve never hesitated to hold his\\nhand in public and i don’t have to\\nthink twice when telling new friends\\nand acquaintances that i have a boy-\\nfriend. ’m more aware than ever of\\nthe privileges i have when i am with\\nhim, and they are mind-blowing in\\ncomparison. and it makes me sad.\\nkeeping her a secret hurt more than\\nanything.\\n\\nif we were given a chance, who\\nknows what would have happened?\\nshe might still be in my life;

|\\nformer steelcase ceo jim =>\\n\\nhackett as the interim\\nathletic director — key\\n\\nword interim.\\n\\nthat got me thinking and\\nactually pretty excited. as\\nof right now, i don’t have\\nany plans for next summer\\nand should probably start working on intern-\\nship and job applications sometime soon. the\\nsearch process for the next athletic director\\nhasn’t begun yet either and anything you see\\nor hear on the news is just hearsay at this\\npoint. so before this opportunity slips away\\nfrom me, i am officially announcing myself as\\na candidate for the athletic director position\\nat the university of michigan.\\n\\nbefore i get written off as unqualified, let\\nme explain. mr. hackett, feel free to use this\\nas acover letter if it suits you.\\n\\nat the press conference, schlissel said the\\nnew athletic director must be “a person of\\nunquestioned integrity, not just integrity to\\nthe level of ncaa rules.”\\n\\nfor starters, i’ve never allegedly e-mailed\\nan alumnus passive-aggressively telling them\\nto “have a happy life” or “stop drinking and go\\nto bed.”\\n\\nsecond, one of my professors referred to\\nme as a “great guy” in office hours. if those\\ntwo examples don’t represent “unquestioned\\nintegrity,” i’m not sure what does. however,\\nfor those still unconvinced about my qualifi-\\ncations, please read on.\\n\\nif you’re worried about my leadership\\nskills, there’s nothing to fear. six people\\nhave endorsed me on linkedin for “leader-\\nship,” and admittedly, i’m pretty proud of\\nthat. small sample size, yes. but i know those\\npeople didn’t hesitate for a second when\\nthey hit the endorse button. that counts for\\nsomething.\\n\\nif you’re looking for someone who knows a\\nthing or two about generating sales and build-\\ning a brand, look no further. i have more than\\n530 followers on twitter — although most of\\nthem think i play for the denver broncos. in\\nthe business, we call that a dedicated follow-\\ning. in my younger days, i ran some pretty\\nsuccessful lemonade stands. and i never once\\nconsidered raising the price to maximize rev-\\nenue because i didn’t want the community\\n\\nderek\\nwolfe\\n\\nrobert schwarzhaupt |\\n\\nto lose faith in me. a 25-cent glass, now and\\nforever. to top it off, ’ve never sold terrible\\npizza. i think that wins a few h.a.i.l. points.\\n\\nschlissel also mentioned that the next\\nathletic director doesn’t have to have\\nmichigan ties. he reiterated this point in an\\ninterview with the daily on monday, “i’m\\nalways open to the idea that someone from\\nthe outside might help us be even better. i just\\nwant to get the best person.”\\n\\nclearly, this is where i’m at a little bit of\\na disadvantage. i am a “michigan man”\\nafter all — if having a university e-mail\\naccount makes you one. however, i contend\\ni would bring a nice balance to the athletic\\ndepartment.\\n\\nfirst off, i never played for legendary\\nfootball coach bo schembechler. in fact, i\\nnever played football. that being said, i’ve still\\nsucceeded in athletics. though you might not\\nbe able tell by looking at me, i was an integral\\nmember of a championship basketball team\\non my hometown’s local recreational league\\n— there were only seven players and my dad\\nwas the coach. for this, i am, and will always\\nbe, a winner. sure, the last guy may have had\\nthree big ten championship rings, but ’m\\nalso confident i got more playing time than\\nhe did.\\n\\nwhile i’ve never worked in an athletic\\ndepartment before, i’ve been to my fair\\nshare of football and basketball games. that\\nshould suffice. i’m also proficient in addition\\nand subtraction so the budget stuff is no\\nbig deal. also, in case you forgot, i’ve run a\\nlemonade stand before. can you say business\\nexperience?\\n\\ni would bring a solid understanding of the\\nstudent voice. heck, when i want student\\ninput on an issue all i’ll have to do is think.\\nno other candidate will be able to say that.\\n\\nwith that, i feel i’ve covered all the bases.\\ni might be the “unorthodox” candidate, but\\nthat’s what the university needs right now:\\nsomeone who’s not afraid to tell it how it is\\nand enact necessary change. someone with\\nvision and relevant experience.\\n\\nlastfriday, whenasked about whatqualities\\nhe envisioned in the future athletic director,\\nschlissel responded, “i have excellence\\nin mind.”\\n\\nif that’s the case, and considering how the\\nprevious athletic director performed, then i\\nmust be the man for the job. some might even\\nsay i’m overqualified. just don’t forget i can’t\\nstart until the summer.\\n\\nacademics come first.\\n\\n— derek wolfe can be reached\\nat dewolfe@umich.edu.\\n\\ninclusive language, only part of the solution\\n\\nithink we need to have a talk about inclusive\\nlanguage and its relation to social justice here\\nat the university. with the new inclusive\\nlanguage campaign kicking off, it’s time we\\nmake sure to keep things in perspective. first\\nof all, i want to recognize my place of privilege\\nin this area. i am a white presenting, middle\\nclass, cisgender male who largely does not face\\nthe mounting burden of micro-aggressions.\\nas always, it is important to keep that in mind\\nas i only face micro-aggressions for my queer\\nidentity, which does play a role in how i view\\nthis topic. however, i’d like to move forward\\nas a student of social science, which will\\ninform my thoughts.\\n\\nthe more social justice circles that i’ve nav-\\nigated through, the more i have come across\\na fixation on making sure language is inclu-\\nsive. people actively make an effort to correct\\neach other in order to make sure their diction\\nis properly inclusive. and while this prac-\\ntice is valuable, and certainly necessary, i am\\nbeginning to worry. yes, language has a pow-\\nerful effect in perpetuating unfair and unjust\\nsystems, dynamics and institutions. yes, lan-\\nguage can be powerfully racist, sexist, bigoted\\nand unintentionally hateful. yes, language is\\na subtle and subversive form of problematic\\nconditioning. and yes, understanding and cor-\\nrecting problematic language is one step in\\ncreating an equitably functional society. how-\\never, this newly growing modern view of strict\\ninclusive language is proving more and more\\ndangerous. simply put, this massive amount\\nof energy focused on only inclusive language\\nin social justice spaces convinces people social\\njustice issues can be fixed simply by applying\\nstrict scrutiny to our words. monitoring lan-\\nguage to be more inclusive, while comforting,\\nactually does very little to help fix the larger\\noppressive macro-systems and institutions\\nthat plague america and fuel injustice. rath-\\ner, inclusive language can be used to create a\\nspace where interpersonal dialogue may lead\\nto generating potential solutions to larger\\n\\nsocial problems. inclusive language is simply\\none method to facilitate the creation of spaces\\nwhere diversity is at the center of the dialogue.\\nhowever, in and of itself, inclusive language\\ndoes very little to solve the larger problems\\nthat fuel injustice in society on a mass scale.\\n\\nbefore i go on, i would like to be clear that\\nmaking people comfortable in social settings\\nis very important. however, let’s not conflate\\nthis with fixing systemic injustice. this\\nmodern fixation on strict scrutiny of language,\\nwhile well-intentioned, takes the focus away\\nfrom realities of fixing our larger society and\\nthe complex tasks associated with it. fixing\\nsocial justice issues will require complex\\nadvocacy, coalition-building, research and\\na real understanding of social dynamics,\\npsychology and politics. it is unfortunate\\nthat policing language is where social justice\\nstarts and ends from many people, because\\nit does nothing to help the real, pressing\\nneeds. the modern practice of language\\npolicing to be “inclusive” fails to recognize\\nthe social politics of interpersonal education,\\nmotivating political support and coalition-\\nbuilding. simply put, it turns many people\\naway from social justice issues in a way that\\ndoes nothing to build support or solve them.\\n\\nagain, let me be clear in saying that\\npeople should be held accountable to their\\nwords. language has a real effect on social\\ninteractions, and everyone should strive to\\nunderstand how their language can make\\npeople feel, but we should be wary on its actual\\nefficacy in solving the problems that have\\nhuge effects on people’s lives such as cyclical\\npoverty and the achievement gap.\\n\\nultimately, policing language is a subtle form\\nof slacktivism and does very little in creating\\nactual change in the way marginalized groups\\nare institutionally oppressed.\\n\\nrobert schwarzhaupt is an lsa senior\\nand a programming board member in\\nthe trotter multicultural center.\\n\\nwhen i abandoned beauty for strength\\n\\nwrong reasons.\\ni heard

own.\\n\\na year ago, i listened to the\\nmagazines, movies, celebrities,\\nfriends and family that told me\\nexercise could move my body far\\naway from its current form. i pored\\nover the advice and tips that detailed\\nhow to lift small weights to achieve\\nthe beauty ideal of the perfect\\nfemale celebrity. they all directed\\nme toward the same end goal — thin\\nand toned. alone with these voices,\\ni had become fogged by the pursuit\\nof changing my body beyond its\\nnormal form.\\n\\ncreating my exercise plan started\\nwith opening the expanding pull-\\nouts from the middle of women’s\\nmagazines. each pull-out displayed\\na sequence of exercises done by\\nwispy white women. they had no\\nsweat, no creases, no fat and were\\nholding only two-pound weights.\\na tv remote could have replaced\\nthe weights they happily clutched.\\nnowhere had i seen images\\nof women lifting weights that\\n\\ndemanded real strength.\\n\\nthough i consumed these images\\nwholeheartedly, they sent me dan-\\ngerous messages. they informed me\\nthat lifting weights should be done,\\nironically, to not gain visible mus-\\ncles. they told me that i should not\\nbe “bulky” or “big” or “muscular.”\\nthey led me to believe that i should\\nwant the opposite. i should not want\\nto inhabit three-dimensional space.\\ni should want to be thin and lean\\nenough, so i appeared defenseless.\\n\\nbesides the visible messages that\\nthe fitness media was imparting, i\\nfound underlying lessons between\\nthe aspiration of thigh gaps. they\\ntold me that by consuming less\\nspace, i would receive more love and\\nworth. the areas my body left blank\\ncould be filled with more points on\\nan attractiveness scale designed by\\nmen. as i peered into the images\\nof perfectly toned women in\\nfitness magazines, i saw their eyes\\nhinting to me that a woman’s body\\nshould never reveal real power nor\\nintimidate men. it was hard to look\\naway. their stare was gripping, and\\nsoon i came to see what they saw.\\n\\neach day, i followed the sequenc-\\nes that were supposed to burn more\\ncalories than cardio. i religiously\\ndid very little weight at high rep-\\netition in order to build leanness\\ninstead of big muscles. the fear of\\nbecoming unattractive sustained\\nmy resistance of looking strong.\\nsoon weightlifting became some-\\nthing i did for others — to allow oth-\\ners to find me attractive and worthy.\\n\\nafter months of revisiting the\\nsame routines and the same corners\\nof the gym, i still was very removed\\nfrom the body i was promised. and\\ni was exhausted. i was exhausted by\\n\\nthe need to constantly adhere to one\\nideal and to exercise feebly. i decid-\\ned to listen to my exhaustion and to\\nabandon what i was supposed to do.\\nas i wished to switch to new rou-\\ntines, i found very little knowledge\\non how a woman can become strong\\ninstead of beautiful.\\n\\nmy journey to find new ways\\nof lifting weights led me to see\\nthe obvious.\\n\\nit’s no wonder that so many\\nwomen of all ages wish to adhere to\\na singular beauty ideal. and it’s no\\nwonder most women believe they\\nwill become massive bodybuilders if\\nthey begin to lift weights. and it’s no\\nwonder that the image of a woman\\nbodybuilder is unattractive, because\\nof its “threatening” demeanor to\\nmen. and it’s no wonder that there\\nis little knowledge circulating\\nwomen’s minds on how to safely\\nand properly lift weights. and it’s\\nno wonder that the free weight\\nsection of every gym lacks women\\nwhile men are overpopulating\\n\\nit. and it’s no wonder i was\\nafraid to ignore norms by\\nbecoming strong.\\n\\nand it’s no wonder when a\\nwoman’s worth is labeled by her\\nneed for the strength of men.\\n\\nafter learning the hidden\\nobviousness, i let my strength truly\\nreveal itself. i let my body move\\ntoward the gravitational pull it\\ndesired. i longed to be strong for\\nmyself and honored my body as it\\nmorphed into unforeseen molds.\\nthrough my journey, i have come to\\nappreciate my ability to grow to its\\nown tune.\\n\\n— maja tosic can be reached\\nat

this came\\nas a shock to many americans who\\nin recent years haven’t read or\\nheard many news stories about the\\nhiv/aids epidemic.\\n\\nsince the initial hiv/aids\\nepidemic started in the 1980s, rates\\nof hiv transmission in the united\\nstates have generally remained\\nstable. according to the centers for\\ndisease control, it’s estimated that\\n1.1 million americans are living\\nwith hiv, and that one out of six\\ndon’t know that they have hiv.\\n\\nthe group in the united states\\nthat remains most affected by hiv/\\naids is msm. hiv infection in\\nthe united states has declined in\\nevery group except gay/bisexual\\nmen. rates of hiv infection have\\nactually been increasing among\\nthis group. from 2008 to 2010,\\nthe rate of new hiv infections for\\nmsm climbed 12 percent. in 2010,\\nmsm made up approximately 4\\npercent of the u.s. population, but\\naccounted for 63 percent of all new\\nhiv infections.\\n\\nin 2010, women accounted for 20\\npercent of all new hiv infections,\\nand 84 percent of these were\\nattributed to heterosexual contact.\\nin that same year, “white msm\\ncontinued to account for the largest\\nnumber of new hiv infections,”\\naccording to the cdc.\\n\\ntherearetwostigmasat playhere:\\nthe assumption in the heterosexual\\npopulation that hiv/aids is a gay\\n\\ndisease, and the assumption in the\\nwhite msm population that hiv/\\naids is a disease associated with\\nminority msm. the mainstream\\nmedia today portrays hiv/aids\\nin the gay community or in iv\\ndrug users. people assume that as\\nlong as they aren’t having sex with\\npeople from these communities\\nthat their risk for hiv isn’t very\\nhigh. these stigmas, along with the\\nlack of a legitimate sex education,\\nthen lead to unsafe sex and not\\nbeing regularly tested for sexually\\ntransmitted infections. in order to\\nstop this unsafe trend, the myths\\n\\nsurrounding hiv/aids must\\nbe dispelled.\\none-fourth of new hiv\\n\\ninfections occur in youth ages 13\\nto 24; most of those infected are\\nunknowing, not getting tested/\\ntreated and potentially infecting\\nmore people. hiv after contraction\\nmay or may not produce symptoms.\\nwithin two to four weeks after the\\ninitial exposure, people may feel\\nflu-like symptoms, but eventually\\nthese symptoms subside.\\n\\nmany people will live years\\nbefore being diagnosed with hiv\\nor aids. in a campus survey our\\nprogram on intergroup relations\\nclass group conducted, only 20\\npercent of respondents have been\\ntested for stis in the last three\\nmonths, and of that 20 percent only\\n11 percent were also tested for hiv.\\ncommon responses for not being\\ntested were that no symptoms are\\npresent, or that respondents did\\nnot think that they were at risk.\\nanother common response was the\\nstigma that goes along with being\\ntested for hiv. respondents didn’t\\n\\nwant their doctors to think they\\nwere gay or having risky sex. this\\nis especially true for bisexual men\\nwho, because of society, choose not\\nto get tested and not to tell partners\\nabout their encounters with men.\\nthe misconceptions around campus\\nabout hiv/aids are apparent.\\n\\nhiv/aids affects people indis-\\ncriminately, and although the only\\nsure way to avoid contracting hiv\\nis through abstinence, there are\\nmany ways to greatly reduce your\\nrisk. these include using latex or\\npolyurethane = condoms/barriers,\\nusing water-based lubricant, ask-\\ning your partner about their sexual\\nhistory, avoiding alcohol or drugs as\\nthey alter the decision-making and\\nchoosing lower-risk sexual activi-\\nties. frequent sti screenings (that\\ninclude hiv) are also essential.\\nalthough hiv/aids is most promi-\\nnent today in the msm and african\\namerican community, all sexually\\nactive people are at risk. especially\\nwhen involved with casual sex part-\\nners who may not have been tested\\nthemselves, or may have lied about\\ntheir sexual histories. sleeping with\\nsomeone is like sleeping with every-\\none that they’ve ever slept with too.\\n\\ntransmission of hiv is fully\\npreventable; most of the new cases\\ncontracted are due to a lack of\\nknowledge and lack of precaution.\\nthere are many great resources in\\nann arbor for both sti testing and\\nsafe sex. for more information about\\nsti testing and hiv/aids statistics,\\nplease visit the cdc

karen hua\\ndaily arts writer\\n\\nthis past thursday, the\\niconic sitcom “two and a half\\nmen” premiered its twelfth and\\n\\nfinal season.\\n\\nthe show\\n\\nhistorically\\n\\nhas been one two and a\\nof the most\\n\\nbeloved and half men\\nhighly-rated on season 12\\ntelevision, but premiere\\n\\nin recent years\\nhasseenseveral thursdays\\n\\nups and downs. at9p.m.\\n\\nat this point,  ¢p5\\n\\nit seems like\\n\\ncbs continues\\n\\nto renew the show simply for\\nthe sake of tradition. while it\\nis true “men” has become a\\nsort of american legend, the\\nshow’s audience is waning and\\ndemonstrates little potential for\\ngrowth.\\n\\nnow with the absence of\\ncharlie (charlie sheen, “anger\\nmanagement”), many viewers\\nhave turned away, even with the\\nyounger, cleaner walden (ashton\\nkutcher, “no strings attached”)\\nas a substitute. with alan’s john\\ncryer, “pretty in pink”) brother\\ngone, and his son jake (angus\\nt. jones, “the rookie”) “in the\\narmy,” the show can only come\\nup with so many fresh premises\\nfor two grown male best friends\\nthat have not been used in sitcoms\\nbefore.\\n\\nthe title no longer makes sense,\\nas jake is now not only a legal\\nadult, but he is also absent in the\\npremiere. even though this will\\nbe its final season, “men” must\\nonly come up with a multitude of\\nexcuses for the disappearance of\\ncharacters as the show runs on\\ndiminishing possibilities.\\n\\nwhether or not the producers\\nlike it, they cannot stop the\\naudience from automatically\\ncomparing kutcher to sheen.\\nperhaps firing the volatile sheen\\nhelped their industry’s image, but\\nmany argue that the series should\\nhave wrapped up with sheen’s\\n\\nie\\n\\n[a\\n\\n“guess we'll just ride this one out...”\\n\\ndismissal. the original character\\ndynamic is simply unparalleled.\\nregardless of kutcher’s talent,\\nsheen still stands as the face of\\nthe show, as he has a #winning\\nstage presence that simply cannot\\nbe matched.\\n\\nthe premiere starts with\\nthe two men and missing half-\\nman, donned in their halloween\\n\\nbest. walden unexpectedly\\nsuffers a heart attack, and after\\nhis “terrifying” near-death\\n\\nexperience, he completely over-\\ndramatizes his dismay to where\\nhis “desperation” seems more like\\nsarcasm.\\n\\nthe premiere continues this\\npattern of amalgamating hilarious\\nmoments with artificial ones\\nto the point where the writing\\nsimply feels uncomfortable.\\nthere are far too many instances\\nwhen walden’s lines are so over-\\ndramatically presented that it is\\nambiguous whether he truly is\\ntrying to sarcastic or genuine.\\n\\nespecially when walden pokes\\nfun at alan, the jokes seemed\\nrehearsed and timed, without\\nthe spontaneity that is supposed\\nto qualify his character as witty.\\nthe humor becomes too cheesy,\\nespecially when it is ambiguous —\\nat least initially — whether walden\\nlegitimately has a heart attack or\\nwhether he fakes it for attention.\\n\\nduring walden’s contemplation\\nof his “purpose of existence,” he\\ndecides he wants to introduce a\\nchild in his life, which ironically\\ncontradicts his free-spirited\\npersona. he’s not supposed to be\\nthe one philosophizing to alan,\\nbut rather vice versa — another\\nstrange discontinuity in the\\npremiere.\\n\\nwalden is rejected from

changing landscape of\\n\\njournalism successfully.\\njulie tiovine, architecture\\ncolumnist for the wall street\\njournal and the _ former\\n\\nexecutive editor for the\\narchitect’s newspaper,

is a native of\\nwashington dc and studied\\nancient greek at yale before\\ndeciding to become a writer.\\nshe developed a love for\\narchitecture after living\\nin athens for a year and\\nlater moved to new york\\ncity to write for various\\npublications, including the\\nnew york times, where she\\nwas on staff for 13 years\\nwriting about architecture\\nand design. in 2008, she\\nbecame executive

to\\narchitecture reporting is\\nthat it’s so embedded into\\nthe real world and you can’t\\nescape it — that’s why i live\\nin new york,” iovine said. “i\\ndon’t want to live in a suburb\\nwhere i don’t see horrible\\nthings, i want to see them,\\nand architecture is like that.\\nit has to face the real stuff,\\nand any architecture that\\ndoesn’t is really missing the\\npoint.”\\n\\nunpaid interns, rented\\ndesks, large paycuts and\\nintensive layoffs were the\\nsacrifices the newspaper\\nhad to make in order to stay\\nafloat during the recession,\\nand in 2012, iovine finally\\nleft the publication as she\\nwas financially unable to stay\\nlonger.\\n\\n“in a fantastic way,\\narchitecture is really used\\nto this ‘boom-bust’ thing,”\\ntovine said. “(the recession)\\nwas a fascinating time to\\nlearn how to stay resilient\\nand dynamically inventive as\\narchitect’s are. they figure\\nout what they need to do to\\nget through, and that’s what\\nwe did. as we look back, it\\nwas actually quite a neat\\ntime.”\\n\\nbefore leaving the\\narchitect’s newspaper,\\niovine helped oversee a large\\ndigital expansion, including\\nlaunching a sleek website\\nas well as facebook and\\ntwitter platforms. iovine\\nnods at critics who question\\nhow such a physical art form\\ncan translate over a digital\\nplatform, yet she believes\\nthe advancements have been\\npositive for architecture.\\n\\n“it’s a good thing and a bad\\nthing. it draws even further\\narchitecture’s tendency to\\nbe a beauty contest, because\\nyou can just splash these\\n\\nspectacular photographs\\nonto the internet and that’s\\nwhat some people think\\n\\nit’s all about,” iovine said.\\n“however, it also fits itself\\nvery smoothly into the world\\nof internet visualization.\\n\\nas architecture has\\nevolved to accommodate\\nand embrace an eco-friendly\\nlandscape, iovine highlighted\\nthe factors that she takes\\ninto consideration during a\\ncritique of a new building, the\\nfoundation for what she does\\nat the wall street journal.\\nin her lecture, she brought\\nup examples of exceptional\\nworks of architecture, which\\nshe believes has changed the\\nfuture of the art.\\n\\n“t need to be able to figure\\nout what’s going on, and\\nwithout the architect telling\\nme. it’s important to me that\\nthe building tells me what’s\\nimportant, and that the space\\nis comprehensible to me just\\nas a user, not as someone who\\nhas just had the architect\\ndescribe it all,” iovine said.\\n“knowing the constraints\\nthat were on the project is\\nalso important, whether it\\nwas budget, or political or\\nzoning issues. people see\\nthese things and may judge\\nit as horrible, but they don’t\\nknow why it’s horrible. it may\\nbe that the community had a\\n\\nstake in it.”\\niovine gave advice to\\ntaubman students looking\\n\\nto break into the competitive\\nworld of architecture, from\\nthe point of view of someone\\nwhose critiques can truly\\nchange public opinion\\nregarding an artist and their\\nbuildings.\\n\\n“you have to be absolutely\\ndevoted,” iovine said. “you\\nmust be ready to join the cult\\nbefore you take that leap,\\nand if you do it can be very\\nrewarding.”\\n\\nin terms of the ever-\\nchanging world of niche\\narts journalism, tovine\\nurged national publications\\nto retain their arts writers\\nand to keep informing and\\nshaping public opinion.\\n\\n“(arts journalism) will\\nthrive, but i worry that it\\nwill only thrive among an\\ninside track and close in on\\nitself,” iovine said. “the gap\\nwill grow between how the\\nwider public understands\\nart and art journalists, and\\nnewspapers are dropping\\ntheir architecture columnists\\nleft and right — there’s only\\nsix architecture columnists\\nleft in national newspapers.\\nthis  shouldn’t be that\\nway. more newspapers and\\nmagazines should think\\nit’s important that there\\nbe someone on hand and\\ndescribe the world and how\\nit’s being shaped.”\\n\\ntaubman graduate student\\nbrooke dexter and taubman\\nsenior alyssa kargl run\\ndimensions, the — student\\narchitecture publication at\\nu-m. dimensions releases one\\nissue yearly and features the\\nwork of dedicated taubman\\nstudents, as well as the\\nwork of outside professional\\nsources like iovine.\\n\\n“one of the things that’s\\n\\nreally important to us is\\nshowcasing student work,\\nbut also including voices\\n\\nfrom outside sources that\\ninfluence the way students\\nthink,” dexter said. “for\\nexample, hearing (lovine)\\nsay that architects need to\\nsimplify their words when\\ntalking to  non-architects\\nis very interesting for us,\\nand helps the student work\\nstay relevant in the outside\\nworld.”\\n\\n“since (taubman students)\\ncome from the same\\narchitecture education,\\nsometimes while working we\\nbecome somewhat similar\\nminded,” kargl said. “we\\nsometimes get caught

route\\nnear the right sideline.\\n\\njust as gardner let go of the\\nball, the hoosiers’ linebacker\\nin coverage jumped the route\\nand appeared to have the ball in\\nhis hands with an easy path to\\nthe end zone. instead, darboh\\nknocked the ball loose and\\nprevented the pick six.\\n\\n“i was kind of thinking ...\\nhit the arm cause i hear the\\n(defensive backs) coach say that\\nall the

michigan’s\\noffense this season. the receiver\\nput that talent on display against\\nindiana, leading the offense with\\nnine receptions for 107 yards and\\na 12-yard touchdown. it was the\\nfirst time the redshirt sophomore\\npassed the century mark in his\\ncareer.\\n\\nall season, darboh has been\\ngardner’s favorite target behind\\njunior devin funchess. but\\nwith funchess usually receiving\\ndouble, sometimes triple,\\ncoverage, gardner has slowly\\ngrown a rapport with darboh,\\nwho has 26 catches for 362 yards\\nand two touchdowns on the\\nseason. two-hundred-fourteen\\nyards of that production have\\ncome in the last three games.\\n\\n“t think, for me, it’s the more\\ni play the more i get used to the\\ngame,” darboh said saturday.\\n“and feel

ten teams\\nin the top-10. through six\\ngames, the golden gophers\\nare seventh in the nation with\\n3.67 goals per game and have\\nconverted 30.4-percent of\\npower-play opportunities, good\\nfor

player-of-\\nthe-year, have ensured that the\\ngolden gophers continue to\\nbe the nation’s most complete\\nteam. with a seemingly weak\\nbig ten, it’s hard to imagine\\nminnesota doing anything\\nshort of running the table in\\nconference play.\\n\\npenn state (5-1-2):\\n\\nlast season’s cellar-dwellers\\ngenerated plenty of momentum\\nwhen it upset michigan in last\\nseason’s big ten tournament.\\nthat momentum has continued\\nthis season. while much of the\\nbig ten has struggled, penn\\nstate has been a surprise starlet\\nin its second season as a varsity\\nprogram. scoring three or more\\ngoals in all but one game, the\\nnittany lions are third in the\\nnation in scoring, and have\\nmade sure to treat their fans —\\nwhich purchased all available\\nseason tickets in three minutes\\n— to entertaining hockey.\\n\\nohio state (2-3-1):\\n\\nafter splitting and largely\\noutplaying no. 12 providence\\nin its opening weekend and\\nvaulting into the rankings,\\nmany felt ohio state’s pieces\\nhad developed enough to avenge\\nlast season’s near-tournament\\nmiss.\\n\\nbut three straight losses\\ntempered expectations for the\\nbuckeyes, who are now 34th\\nin both offense and defense\\nand have shown little signs of\\nemerging from mediocrity.\\n\\nmichigan state (2-4):\\n\\nmichigan state was among\\nthe bottom five teams in\\nthe country in nearly every\\noffensive category last season.\\nthis year hasn’t been much\\ndifferent. with the exception\\nof forward matt berry, who\\nis seventh in the nation with\\nfive goals, the spartans have\\na dismal 13 goals through six\\ngames, have already been shut\\nout twice, are 2-for-28 on the\\npower play and have just five\\ngoals in their last four games.\\n\\ndespite the woes and poor\\nstart, michigan state has\\nshown it may not need to score\\nthat many goals to win down\\nthe road. led by goaltender\\njake hildebrand — among the\\nnation’s best netminders — the\\nspartans are allowing just two\\ngoals per game, with the clip\\nlowering to 1.25 against ranked\\nteams.\\n\\nwisconsin (0-4):\\n\\nof all the big ten teams\\ngoing through growing pains,\\nwisconsin has had it the worst.\\nafter opening the season 10th\\nin the country, the badgers\\nhave yet to win a game. with\\n13 freshmen, wisconsin limped\\nto two consecutive bye weeks\\nhaving scored just three goals,\\nfewest in the nation, and going\\n0-for-18 on the power play.\\n\\nit’s almost a given that\\nwisconsin will get better,\\nbut with 5-of-6 upcoming\\n\\ngames against ranked teams,\\nimprovement won’t necessarily\\ntranslate into wins.\\n\\n“the more i\\nplay, the more i\\nget used to the\\n\\ngame.”\\n\\nry\\n\\non a broken play that required\\nimprovisation from the receiver.\\nhe had to cut his route short as\\ngardner was pressured in the\\npocket. gardner then aired it out\\nto give darboh\\ntime to adjust\\nand get under\\nthe ball. the\\ntiming worked\\nand  darboh\\nmade the play.\\nafter seeing\\nselect time\\nduring his\\ntrue freshman\\nseason, mostly\\non special\\nteams, darboh sat out last season\\nafter sustaining a preseason foot\\ninjury. his

7a\\n\\nchatman stepping\\ninto starter’s role\\n\\nby jake lourim\\ndaily sports editor\\n\\nyes, michigan freshman\\nkameron chatman plays a very\\nsimilar style to former wolverine\\nglenn robinson iii. yes, he plays\\nthe same position as robinson\\ndid. and yes, robinson left that\\nspot open when he declared for\\nthe nba draft last spring.\\n\\nbut no, chatman is not looking\\nto replace robinson.\\n\\n“it wouldn't really compare\\nmyself to him,” he said thursday\\nat the team’s media day. “he was\\na great player, but i don’t really\\ngo out there and try to compare\\nmyself to him.”\\n\\nwhether he likes it or not,\\nchatman will be counted on at\\nleast sometimes this season to fill\\nthe void robinson left.\\n\\nchatman feels good about\\nhis basketball iq as he prepares\\nto play meaningful minutes\\nin his first season. michigan\\ncoach john beilein’s success at\\nturning freshman role players\\ninto sophomore stars has been\\nwell-documented, but chatman\\nthinks he’s ready to step in right\\naway.\\n\\nbeilein is still undecided on\\na possible starting lineup, but\\nchatman has the potential to fill\\nthat void. chatman is 6-foot-7,\\n210 pounds, robinson 6-foot-6,\\n220. chatman was the no. 38\\noverall recruit in the 2014 class\\nand was listed as asmall forward,\\nbut projects to be a stretch-four,\\nmuch like robinson.\\n\\n“he’s going to play both\\nforward positions as well, and if\\nwe ever got stuck, he could play\\nin the backcourt,” beilein said\\noct. 2 before the team opened\\npractice. “all of the freshmen are\\nok. what happens when we put\\ntwo or three weeks together?”\\n\\nthe wolverines have now\\n\\nput four weeks together, and\\nthursday at open practice,\\nchatman looked the part of a\\nstarter. he showed his length\\nand athleticism on both sides,\\nmuch like robinson did. he was\\nknocked around abit during mock\\ncontact drills, but he is already\\nlisted at 10 pounds heavier than\\nhe is in his recruiting profile.\\n\\nand despite the possible\\ndifference in physicality, he is\\nan inch taller with a wingspan\\nsimilar to robinson’s.\\n\\n“we saw early that he could be\\na rotation guy,” beilein said. “we\\nhave a rating system that we use\\nthat i won’t share with you, but\\nthere’s a number we give a guy\\nwho we feel is in the rotation of\\ntop eight as a freshman, and he\\ngraded out at that.”\\n\\nthe coach said being in the\\ntop five and being ready to start\\nis very different, another step\\nup from his current spot in the\\ntop-eight rotation. but with\\nsophomore derrick walton\\njr., junior caris levert and\\nsophomore zak irvin appearing\\nas clear starters, chatman looks\\nto be one of the viable candidates\\nfor the fourth spot, beside a host\\nof big men at the ‘5.’\\n\\nthat doesn’t mean he can’t\\nslide to the ‘2’ or ‘3’ to fill in.\\n\\n“we have guards, we have\\nforwards and we have a guy that\\nplays in the middle,” beilein said\\noct. 2. “sometimes, we’ll have\\nfour of them out there at one time\\nthat are guards. because of kam’s\\nball handling ability, i think he\\ncan play a lot of positions.”\\n\\nfor now, chatman’s skill puts\\nhim in a good spot for playing\\ntime starting with monday’s\\nexhibition against |§ wayne\\nstate. he'll likely be playing in\\nrobinson’s old spot, and he’ll be\\ncompared to him, whether he\\nlikes it or not.\\n\\n“the best coaching staff in america’\\n\\nby minh doan\\ndaily sports writer\\n\\nthe michigan women’s\\nbasketball coaching staff spends\\nso much time together that\\nsometimes, coach kim barnes\\narico jokes they need mandatory\\ntime away from each other.\\n\\n“sometimes we need to say,\\n‘t’m not allowed to see you,’\\nbecause i could show up at\\nchurch and there’s (assistant)\\ncoach (melanie) moore with\\nher family as well,” barnes\\narico said.\\n\\nbut it’s that family-type\\natmosphere barnes arico has\\ntried to cultivate that has created\\nsuccess within the program.\\n\\nwith players coming and\\ngoing every year, the variable\\nthat has remained constant is\\nthe coaching staff.\\n\\nthat’s why michigan was able\\nto get back to the postseason\\nafter losing its core after barnes\\narico’s first year.\\n\\nand that’s why this group\\nof coaches is as barnes arico\\nsaid, “the best coaching staff in\\namerica.”\\n\\n“it’s family here,” moore\\nsaid. “i have two little ones\\nat home, and they’re around\\nthe staff because they’re great\\npeople. they’re all here for one\\ngoal, which is to put michigan\\nwomen’s basketball on the map.\\nwe have each other’s back, and\\nit’s a great atmosphere.”\\n\\noff the basketball court, the\\nstaff spends time together with\\nactivities such as watching\\nfootball games together and\\nsunday dinners at barnes arico’s\\nhouse.\\n\\n“we're with these guys more\\nthan we are with our own\\nfamilies,” moore said. “(barnes\\narico) does an excellent job of\\nmaking sure we have excellent\\nchemistry on our staff.”\\n\\nthe dynamic is a cohesive\\none, too. michigan boasts a\\ncoaching staff that is comprised\\nof only women, with moore and\\nbarnes arico being mothers.\\n\\n“ti think one of the greatest\\nthings about having an_all-\\nwoman staff is that you really\\nunderstand the players,” barnes\\n\\narico said. “and with some of us\\nbeing moms, we understand how\\nthe kids in our program need to\\nbe treated as someone’s child, as\\nwell as how they can be pushed\\nand challenged.”\\n\\nbeyond chemistry and\\ncohesion, two of the three\\nassistant coaches already had\\nexperience coaching with\\nbarnes arico at st. john’s, with\\nassistant coach joy mccorvey\\neven playing for her.\\n\\nmccorvey came to ann\\narbor with barnes arico from\\nst. john’s, where she was\\npart of the staff that broke\\nconnecticut’s 99-game home\\nwinning streak in 2012.\\n\\nshe played under barnes\\narico from 2006-2010 with the\\nred storm, where she was a\\ncaptain and ranked third all-\\ntime in st. john’s history with\\n\\n777 career rebounds.\\n“t think one of the greatest\\nattributes joy has is she\\n\\nunderstands me better than\\nanyone else,” barnes arico\\nsaid. “she really knows the\\nexpectations and the demands\\nt have.”\\n\\nmccorvey, who coaches the\\npost players, was instrumental\\nin senior forward cyesha\\n\\ngoree’s success last season.\\n\\nwhile she is known to be\\ntougher on the players, with just\\nfour years since mccorvey was\\nin college, she has also become\\nsomething ofa big sister to many\\nof the players, including goree.\\n\\nassistant coach megan duffy\\nis in her first season at michigan\\nafter making the move from\\ngeorge washington, where she\\nwas also an assistant. before\\nshe coached the colonials,\\nthough, she coached at st. john’s\\nwith barnes arico, and when a\\nposition opened up at michigan,\\nit was a seamless fit.\\n\\n“when we had an opening, i\\ncalled coach duffy, as kind of\\nset up, and asked her ‘would you\\nrecommend anyone?’ without\\nmentioning her,” barnes arico\\nsaid. “a couple days later,\\n(duffy) called me back and said,\\n‘why didn’t you mention me?’...\\nand the rest is history.”\\n\\nfive years removed from\\nthe wnba, duffy still has the\\nsame competitive drive that got\\nher drafted 31st overall by the\\n\\nminnesota lynx.\\n“coach duffy’s a bit of a\\nperfectionist,” barnes arico\\n\\nsaid. “she checks in with (the\\nplayers) constantly, to make sure\\n\\nour point guards are the best in\\nthe country.”\\n\\nmoore is the only coach on\\nstaff who didn’t know barnes\\narico personally before coming\\nto michigan, but the first time\\nbarnes arico talked to her, she\\nknew moore would be a good fit\\non her staff.\\n\\ncoming from _ princeton,\\nmoore understands the time\\ncommitments of being a student-\\nathlete at an academics-heavy\\nuniversity. this has made her\\ntransition from the ivy league\\nto the big ten easy.\\n\\nmoore, who coaches the\\nguards, is known for her\\nenergetic and positive coaching\\nstyle.\\n\\n“coach moore is_ super\\npositive, she’s ‘p-squared in\\na-squared, positive patty in ann\\narbor,” barnes arico said. “she’s\\nenergetic, she’s encouraging,\\nand the kids love to be around\\nher.”\\n\\nwith such a_ turnaround\\nfrom barnes arico’s first and\\nsecond years, when she lost a\\nfull starting lineup, the program\\ncontinues to make a name for\\nitself in the ncaa.\\n\\nand it’s all due to “the best\\ncoaching staff in america.”\\n\\nluna anna archey/daily\\nmichigan women's basketball coach kim barnes arico has helped assemble a familiar staff to help her teams succeed.\\n\"},\n",

mackens\\n\\ncover by ruby wallau\\n\\nfrom the pews: the evolution of my methodism\\n\\nby claire bryan\\n\\noming to college, i shoved\\nc= religion forcibly to the\\n\\nback of my brain. for once\\ni didn’t have to look for the twinge\\nin my father’s eye as i declined his\\ngrey slacks, button down and trips\\nto church with our grandmoth-\\ner, and in turn ate his eggs on an\\norange ceramic plate, balancing on\\nmy bare knees, curled up in the cor-\\nner of the couch.\\n\\ni watch many of my friends pack\\nup their backpacks at 9 p.m. on\\nsunday nights to leave the library\\nand walk to church service. every\\nweek, parentless, rule-free college\\nstudents prioritize their faith over\\ntheir studies, over their sleep, over\\nan extra hour of late night conver-\\nsation with friends.\\n\\nbut this summer, noise around\\nhomosexuality in the united\\nmethodist church compelled me\\nto return to 10 o’clock service on\\na 90-degree morning, to join indi-\\nviduals who believed our church’s\\nmission statement should change,\\nand propelled me to examine the\\nfinite meaning of how i stand as a\\nmethodist.\\n\\nthe united methodist church\\ntoday is at a crossroads. among\\nall participants, from individuals\\nsitting in the pews, to pastors of\\nchurches, to clergy of the office\\nof the bishop, the discipline is\\nbeing scrutinized and changes are\\nmanifesting in some of the largest,\\n\\nmost tangible ways. the advocacy\\ngroup, reconciling ministries\\nnetwork, is mobilizing united\\nmethodist churches across the\\ncountry to rewrite their mission\\nstatements and be open and affirm-\\ning of all lgbtq persons.\\n\\nreverend frank schaefer, a\\n\\nsesu s on thomosexvali ry\\n\\nunited method-\\nist minister, lost his\\nordination creden-\\n\\ntials after marrying\\nhis own gay son to\\nanother man. after\\nthree phases of his\\ntrial in front of the\\n\\nunited methodist\\nchurch’s judicial\\ncouncil, schaefer\\n\\nwas defrocked for\\nviolating his pasto-\\nral vows. six months\\nlater an appeals\\npanel of church offi-\\ncials overturned that\\ndecision and wel-\\ncomed him back into\\nhis role. this is one\\ncase among hundreds\\nthat lacks fluid consen-\\nsus. some bishops punish\\nclergymen and women who have\\nopenly performed gay marriages\\nwith preventing them to work for a\\nday or a week. other bishops revoke\\ntheir credentials entirely, shaming\\nthem and stripping them of the job\\nthey passionately believe in. the\\ndifferences in their approach to the\\nissue are immense and incoherent.\\n\\nmy church’s motto, “open\\nminds, open hearts, open doors,”\\nwhich had been engrained in every\\npamphlet, sunday school activity\\nand sermon growing up, did not\\nhold true. in ann arbor, i found\\nthat the wesley foundation, a\\nuniversity of michigan campus\\nministry of the united methodist\\nchurch, was worlds ahead of my\\nchurch back home. one evening,\\ni questioned reverend rob roth,\\nthe current chaplain of the wesley\\nfoundation, about how his church\\ntransformed into a rec-\\nonciling one — and as i\\ndid my own resistance\\nto methodism morphed.\\n\\nit didn’t come from\\nthe facts that stood\\nclear in my mind con-\\nfsistently. there are\\nseven major passages in\\nthe bible condemning\\nhomosexuality in some\\n_a‘orm — none of them\\n\\nare jesus speaking, and\\n\\nmore importantly, none\\n\\nof them speak to how\\n\\nwe understand homo-\\n\\nsexuality or bisexuality\\n\\n: * s { ez .\\n\\\\ | ——— 7 ss\\n\\\\ \\\\ ra = as\\n‘ \\\\ i\\n\\nillustrations by megan mulholland\\n\\nin 2014. modern psychology hasn’t\\nrecognized homosexuality as men-\\ntal illness for decades and method-\\nism respects the science of its time.\\nmethodism stays consistent to its\\ninterpretations. if we take leviti-\\ncus 18:22, “thou shalt not lie with\\nmankind, as with womankind: it is\\nabomination,” that would mean we\\nwould need to take every passage,\\nevery sin and punishment, literally.\\n\\nbut where my identity evolved\\nwas where i learned that being\\nmethodist did not mean stand-\\ning with a list of beliefs every one\\nof my fellow methodists believed.\\nissues of homosexuality would not\\nbe on that list, because methodism,\\nunlike so many religions, does not\\nhave a list. we have articles of faith\\nin our discipline that we respect but\\nwe are not a confessional church.\\ninstead, we have a quadrilateral\\nscripture that embodies: scripture,\\ntradition, reason and experience.\\nmethodists, by definition, means\\nthe person sitting next to you in\\nthe pew takes scripture, tradition,\\nreason and experience in any form\\nthey believe. we are not taught or\\ndirected, we are enlightened and\\ngiven the opportunity to interpret.\\nand today, not enough have inter-\\npreted and understood that those\\nseven passages should not keep\\ngays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgen-\\nder or any other humans out of the\\nchurch. we must continue to inter-\\npret so others can continue to stand\\nas methodists.\\n\"},\n",

it’s not to stay com-\\nplacent, it’s time to accelerate\\nand go even faster,” snyder said.\\n\\nsnyder hinted at some of\\nhis goals for his second term,\\nlike filling tens of thousands of\\nskilled trade jobs, helping young\\npeople connect with education\\nopportunities and improving\\naccess to career technical edu-\\ncation, all of which he hopes will\\nlead to more well-paying middle\\nclass jobs.\\n\\nfour years after running on\\n\\na pledge to reinvent michigan’s\\neconomy, snyder was able to\\nsecure a second term largely\\non his fulfillment of that prom-\\nise. his supporters point to his\\nhands-on approach to detroit’s\\nrecovery as a signature accom-\\nplishment of his first term. the\\nstate legislature, the city and its\\ncreditors and pensioners struck\\na grand bargain that allowed\\nthe city to move ahead with its\\nbankruptcy proceedings, which\\nwill wrap up this month.\\n\\non higher education, snyder\\ncut state funding in 2011 with\\nthe promise to raise it again in\\nsubsequent years. he has incre-\\nmentally increased the funding\\nbut has yet to return it to the 2011\\nlevels. consequently, schauer\\nattempted to brand himself as\\nthe “education governor” in his\\ncampaign, calling for its funding\\nto be restored to pre-2011 levels\\nupon election to office.\\n\\nin terms of the statewide\\neconomy, snyder repealed the\\nmichigan business tax and\\nreplaced it with a flat tax to\\nappeal to new businesses, and\\neach of his last two budgets\\nhave resulted in a surplus. addi-\\ntionally, the state’s 7.2-percent\\n\\nsee snyder, page 4a\\n\\nin dark day\\n\\ndemocratic u.s. detroit following her conces-\\nsion.\\n\\nsenate candidate peters will succeed fellow\\n\\n. democrat carl levin, who has\\n\\nbucks national served in the u.s. senate for\\n\\nmore than 35 years. the seat\\n\\ntr end was originally expected to be\\n\\nhotly contested and potentially\\n\\nby shoham geva a key race to determine which\\n\\ndaily staff reporter\\n\\nu.s. house rep. gary peters\\n(d-detroit) will be the next\\nu.s senator from michigan.\\n\\npeters, who has served in the\\nu.s house of representatives\\nfor five years, faced off against\\nterri lynn land, former\\nmichigan secretary of state.\\nthe race was called by cnn\\nand the detroit free press at 9\\np.m, and as of press time early\\nwednesday morning with 95\\npercent of precincts reporting,\\npeters led land 55 percent to\\n41 percent.\\n\\nminutes after peters’ pro-\\njected win was announced,\\nland called peters to concede.\\nshe did not release a statement,\\ntalk to the press or speak to\\nthe republican watch party in\\n\\nparty would be the overall\\nmajority in the senate.\\n\\nhowever, peters, who main-\\ntained a slight lead in the polls\\nover land throughout much\\nof the general election season,\\npulled away from his opponent\\nsignificantly by the last quar-\\nter of the race to a double-digit\\nlead.\\n\\n“michigan was obviously a\\nsquandered opportunity for\\nthe republicans,” political\\nscience prof. michael trau-\\ngott said tuesday night. “her\\ncampaign got off to a bad start\\nbecause of the initial interac-\\ntion with the media, so her\\ncampaign team decided to\\nhide her from reporters and\\nrestricted her access to voters\\nat public events, so she never\\n\\nsee peters, page 4a\\n\\nnew on michigandaily.com\\nthe working ethic: college ethics 101\\nmichigandaily.com/blogs\\n\\ngot a news tip?

faculty\\n\\nboarded a bus outside the university’s\\n\\nschool of public health. the destination\\n— detroit.\\n\\nhowever, this group wasn’t going to visit the\\ntourist hotspots. while eastern market and the\\nrenaissance center were on the itinerary, these\\nparticipants had signed up to see some of the\\nmost polluted and industrialized areas of the\\ncity, hear about the historic factors that brought\\nthe city to its current state and to learn about\\nthe public health concerns for residents in these\\nareas.\\n\\n“detroit’s a challenging place — it’s an inter-\\nesting place,” said sociology prof. reynolds far-\\nley, one of the trip leaders for the 2014 tour of\\ntoxic sites, sponsored by the university’s center\\nfor occupational health and safety engineering.\\n\\nfor better or worse, the city has for decades\\nbeen used as a case study for some of society’s\\nmost serious economic and social concerns.\\nfrom the collapse of the auto industry to the his-\\ntory of racial tensions, academics use detroit as a\\nmodel for other similar u.s. cities.\\n\\nthe annual tour seeks to provide future pub-\\nlic health and social justice workers with a first-\\nhand look at contemporary issues, reflecting\\nthe university’s growing involvement — both\\nacademically and socially — in the city in recent\\nyears.\\n\\nas the bus and its 30 to 40 passengers left ann\\narbor, farley began discussing the impact of the\\ncity’s history on the current environmental con-\\ncerns.\\n\\nthe rise of an industrial giant\\n\\nfounded as a trading post in the early 16th\\ncentury, detroit saw significant population and\\nindustrial growth starting in 1855 with the com-\\npletion of two major projects — a railroad con-\\nnecting the city to new york and chicago and\\nthe completion of the locks at sault ste. marie,\\nputting detroit in the position to utilize michi-\\ngan’s industrial resources — white pine, iron ore\\nand copper — to become an industrial power-\\nhouse.\\n\\nthe civil war spurred demand for such\\nindustrial products, and the city grew from a\\npopulation of 21,000 in 1850 to almost 300,000\\nby 1900.\\n\\nthe industrial boom marked the start of\\nmajor pollution problems in the city and region.\\nlong before the era of government regula-\\ntion and oversight, manufacturers often simply\\ndumped industrial waste into the detroit river\\nor let it soak into the ground around the plants\\nthat produced them. some of those toxic effects\\ncan still be felt today.\\n\\nbut any industrial ‘boom’ of the 19th century\\npales in comparison with the growth of industry\\nin the early 20th century as detroit gave birth to\\nthe u.s. auto industry. the ‘big 3’ automakers —\\nford, general motors, and chrysler — all set up\\nshop in the city.\\n\\nin 1917, ford motor co. began construction\\non its river rouge complex, the single larg-\\nest industrial complex in the world at the time.\\nat its height, it employed more than 100,000\\nworkers and still operates in a limited capac-\\nity today, though it was sold by the ford family\\nand has been downsized due to environmental\\nrestrictions. the company now operates several\\nmodern plants in the surrounding area and in\\n\\nlearin\\n\\ndearborn. according to the sierra club, a nation-\\nal environmental preservation group founded\\nin 1892, these plants produced over 600,000\\npounds of toxic pollutants in 2010, contributing\\nthe “largest burden of environmental pollution”\\nin detroit.\\n\\ngeneral motors opened a cadillac assembly\\nplant near mexicantown in 1921 and later relo-\\ncated to their detroit/hamtramck assembly\\nfacility north of the city in 1985. the company\\npurchased the iconic waterfront renaissance\\ncenter in 1996 to serve as its world headquarters.\\naccording to the sierra club, the hamtramck\\nfacility produced over 180,000 pounds of toxic\\nreleases and over 240,000 pounds of other waste\\nin 2010.\\n\\nfarley noted that recognizing the city’s his-\\ntory is vital to understanding its continuing\\nstruggles.\\n\\n“people don’t spend a whole lot of time think-\\ning about cities and how the history of cities,\\nwhen homes were built and factories were built,\\nhow that influences the present,” farley said.\\n“but, they’re open to thinking about it; they seem\\nto be interested.”\\n\\nthe grassroots movement\\n\\nafter a brief tour of downtown and lunch at\\neastern market, students and faculty boarded\\nthe toxic tour bus for the main event — a look\\nat some of the most polluted and industrialized\\nareas of the city.\\n\\ncharles stokes works for detroiters work-\\ning for environmental justice, an organization\\npartnered with the university’s school of public\\nhealth, and joined the bus tours to provide stu-\\n\\ndents with context from a local resident’s per-\\nspective.\\n\\nstokes highlighted the pollution in detroit as\\nan environmental justice issue. in his position,\\nhe works as an organizer spreading the word\\nto afflicted neighborhoods about the dangers of\\nvarious toxic sites and unite people to pressure\\nthe city to make changes.\\n\\namong the many locations on the tour’s itin-\\nerary were the rouge steel plant, the marathon\\noil refinery, and the waste treatment plant.\\nstokes explained how these locations contribute\\nto carbon dioxide levels and other forms of air\\npollution, as well as producing harmful indus-\\ntrial byproducts, such as petroleum coke, during\\nthe process of refining raw tar sands — mostly\\nimported from alberta, canada — into oil.\\n\\nthe tour also visited the detroit municipal\\nwaste incinerator, a contentious topic in the\\ncity for years and known for its infamous smell.\\nstokes organized area residents to continu-\\nally file odor complaints against the incinerator\\nbased on reports that the smell has caused peo-\\nple to feel nauseous and, in some cases, become\\nmore seriously ill.\\n\\nopened in 1986, the waste incinerator is the\\nlargest of its kind in the u.s., accommodating\\nover 3,000 tons of garbage ona daily basis. along\\nwith the long-standing debate over the plant’s\\nodor, the facility also emits airborne substances,\\nsuch as nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and car-\\nbon monoxide, which have created public health\\nconcerns in the community.\\n\\nafter the actions taken by residents and envi-\\nronmental groups, michigan’s department of\\nenvironmental quality brought suit against the\\nprivate company that now owns the incinerator.\\nin the past two weeks, the city passed a consent\\nagreement mandating the operators update the\\nincinerator’s air ducts to reduce the odor within\\ntwo years or face a fine.\\n\\nwhile the proceedings demonstrated the\\nability of community groups to help rectify envi-\\nronmental injustice in the city, the incinerator\\nis only one of many such facilities that are wor-\\nrisome to residents. stokes said there is still\\nplenty of work to be done, but that he is proud so\\n\\nfar with the progress. additionally, he said\\n\\neducating university students is a key\\n\\npart of ensuring solutions for the\\nfuture.\\n\\n“we stand on the shoulders\\n\\nof those who came before us\\n\\nand so i offer my shoulders\\n\\nfor those who would like\\n\\nto stand on them,” he said.\\n\\n“when you have the ear of\\n\\na bunch of ‘world-changers,’\\n\\nwhat i mean is those students,\\n\\ntheir future’s not defined yet\\n\\nand so we’re going to help instill\\n\\nsomething that is based in justice\\n\\nequality and participation of all peoples.”\\nenvironmental injustice\\n\\nhistorically, industry and residential areas\\nof detroit were built in close proximity to one\\nanother, as this made the most sense for work-\\ners who needed to commute. despite a modern\\nunderstanding of the environmental concerns\\ntoday, farley said it can be difficult both politi-\\ncally and financially to relocate people away\\nfrom pollution sites.\\n\\ninstead, residents and grassroots organizers\\nare working to have industry more strictly regu-\\nlated. so far, the results are mixed, as facilities\\nsuch as the marathon refinery have pledged to\\nreduce emissions, while at the same time con-\\ntinuing to increase their facility’s output.\\n\\naccording to a report from the detroit

environ-\\nmental protection agency could be doing more\\nto regulate industries.\\n\\nfurthermore, the sierra club contends that\\nthe environmental impacts are not evenly dis-\\ntributed among the state’s population. citing\\nresearch from natural resources prof. paul\\nmohai, the report indicates that over 80 percent\\nof african-american students attend school in\\nthe top decile of polluted areas in the state, as\\nopposed to 44 percent of white students.\\n\\nat the start of the auto boom in the 1920s,\\ndetroit’s population was over 95 percent white.\\nthe middle class thrived under the plethora of\\nskilled manufacturing jobs. by the end of the\\n20th century, however, the demographics had\\nundergone a massive shift. in 2010, blacks made\\nup over 82 percent of residents.\\n\\nwhile middle-class workers had the ability to\\nmove to the suburbs or leave the city entirely, less\\nadvantaged groups were left to deal with the fall-\\nout of years of environmental degradation.\\n\\n“there were no incentives to cooperate on\\nmajor issues, like economic development, trans-\\n\\nportation, education, or environmental protec-\\ntion,” farley said. “the suburban communities\\nwent their own way and competed with the city\\nand ... city-suburban disputes often turned into\\nnasty black-white disputes.”\\n\\nin 2013, sierra club detroit referred to the\\nenvironmental pollution in the city as a “human\\nrights abuse” and “environmental injustice.”\\ngrassroots organizations, such as detroiters\\nworking for environmental justice, have taken\\non initiatives to improve underprivileged com-\\nmunities.\\n\\n“given the contamination of their immediate\\nenvironments, these communities have inordi-\\nnately high levels\\n\\ntal justice in det\\n\\nfnior news editors\\n[llingham & will greenberg\\n\\nof asthma, cancer, neu-\\nrological disorders and\\nbirth defects,” the sierra\\nclub report stated.\\ndelray resident forest\\nhudson acknowledged that\\npollution is a major concern\\nin his area.\\n\\n“the area’s a dump, but i love it,” hudson\\nsaid. “i know there’s a lot of toxic waste.”\\n\\nat the community center where he works,\\nlines of smokestacks surround the soccer fields\\nwhere children come for after-school activities.\\nthe air smells of sulfur and garbage.\\n\\n“tt’s just background,” hudson said, referenc-\\ning the close proximity of the industry.\\n\\nbut he said people in\\nthe community are fighting\\nback, despite a seeming lack\\nof involvement from city\\nofficials. as hudson puts\\nit, people are “fighting for\\ntheir livelihood” and there\\nis an increasing effort to\\nhold government officials\\naccountable in remedying\\nthe concerns.\\n\\nin addition to industry,\\ndelray lies in the midst of\\nmajor trucking and ship-\\nping routes near the uss.\\nterminal for the ambas-\\nsador bridge, a major thor-\\noughfare of u.s.-canadian\\neconomic trade. as many\\nas 9,000 trucks pass these\\ncheckpoints each day.\\n\\nthe city has passed\\nanti-idling laws to pro-\\nhibit trucks waiting near\\nthe bridge terminals from\\ncontaminating surround-\\ning neighborhoods with air\\npollution, but these laws are\\nrarely enforced by police.\\nin addition, reports indi-\\ncate that the approach to\\nthe ambassador bridge is |\\nplagued by delays.\\n\\nnow, there are plans to |\\nexpand such operations by\\nopening a new bridge by\\n2020 to accommodate larg-\\n\\n/\\n\\n7\\n\\nthe toxic tour\\n\\nford plant |\\n\\na l\\noakwood heights\\n\\nmarathon refinery\\n\\ner trade

plaza.\\n\\nhe said the city plans to buy his house next\\nyear. motioning to an image on the wall of the\\ncommunity center, he said there were originally\\nplans to build a community for the displaced\\nresidents, but those plans fell through — the area\\nproposed for housing was deemed more appro-\\npriate for expanding industry.\\n\\nas for his community, hudson said he’s\\nunsure if their efforts to garner aid from the city\\nwill yield results.\\n\\n“tt’s only a mat-\\nter of time before\\nwe know one way\\n\\nor another whether\\nthey take our con-\\ncerns seriously,” he said.\\n\\nneighborhood negotiations\\n\\nit’s no secret that detroit made its mark as an\\nindustrial giant, and with industry comes pol-\\nlution. however, as detroiters argue, pollution\\nin the city is no longer simply an environmental\\nconcern, but a social disparity as well.\\n\\nthe city’s population has shrunk from nearly\\ntwo million at its height in the 1950s to about\\n700,000 today. those that remain do so for a\\nvariety of reasons — some feel loyal to the city\\nwhile others lack the resources to move else-\\nwhere. regardless, the shifting demographics\\nmean that those responsible for creating a toxic\\n\\nenvironment are not the ones suffering from its\\neffects.\\n\\nthe collapse of the auto industry and subse-\\nquent municipal bankruptcy have resulted in the\\ndownsizing or closure of some of detroit’s most\\niconic facilities — such as ford’s river rouge\\nplant — which are replaced with newer, decen-\\ntralized production models. at the new ford\\ncomplex, environmental efforts are underway\\nto limit emissions and protect water sources.\\nthe new facility boasts one of the largest “living\\nroofs” in the world, using natural grasses and\\nplants to reduce the plant’s energy consumption\\n— a promising effort toward increasing environ-\\nmentally minded industry around the city.\\n\\nother companies have developed their own\\nstrategies for dealing with increasing environ-\\nmental regulation.\\n\\nin oakwood heights, a few residents are\\nholding out against marathon petroleum co.,\\nwhich has bought homes from over 300 residents\\n— paying an average of $65,000 per home — as\\npart of a plant expansion effort. by removing\\nresidents, the company can effectively increase\\nits distance from residential areas, bypassing\\ncertain restrictions based around proximity to\\nhomes.\\n\\nby simply refusing to sell their homes, these\\nresidents have been thrust into the middle of a\\ndebate that will likely

       " 'a-11.png': {'text': '| 6b | wednesday, november 5, 2014 // the statement\\n\\ndo u.s. colleges have something to learn from german tuition policy?\\nby rachel premack\\n\\nen german universities began\\n\\ncharging tuition in 2006, the back-\\n\\nlash was swift. at the university of\\n\\nfreiburg, where university of michigan his-\\n\\ntory department chair kathleen canning\\n\\nwas administering a study abroad program in\\n\\nthe 2000s, students occupied classrooms and\\n\\nhung enormous banners that read, “education\\nis a human right.”\\n\\nthe fees that caused the outrage? an aver-\\nage of $630 per semester. at this university,\\nin-state lsa students pay $6,579 and out-\\nof-staters pay $20,789.\\n\\n“it didn’t matter how much it was,”\\ncanning said. “it didn’t matter that it was\\naffordable for most middle-class fami-\\nlies. it was the principal of introducing\\ntuition.”\\n\\nlucky for the students, the final ger-\\nman federal state abolished tuition in\\noctober. now anyone — german citizen\\nor not — can receive a free college educa-\\ntion at one of germany’s globally lauded\\nuniversities.\\n\\npast german college students are now\\namong world-renowned philosophers,\\nresearchers, entrepreneurs, writers and\\nleaders. the nation is the world’s third-\\nlargest importer and exporter. more\\nnobel laureates are from germany than\\nany other nationality — save for the u.s.\\nand u.k.\\n\\nso why don’t these students have to\\npay the thousands of dollars per year that\\namericans do?\\n\\ntuition in the united states has not\\nalways been so high. at the university, adjust-\\ning for inflation, in-state students paid $1,472\\nin the 1969-1970 academic year. it rose, by\\ndecade, to $1,970 in 1980, $3,065 in 1990 and\\n$5,704 by 2000.\\n\\njust as well, until the mid-20th century,\\nhigher education was something attainable\\nonly by the most elite social classes in ger-\\nmany.\\n\\n“the whole notion of buildings, education,\\nwas a fundamental attribute of the bourgeoi-\\nsie and the nobility,” canning said. “it was not\\nsomething that anyone in the middle class or\\nlower middle class could aspire to.”\\n\\nuniversity education remains somewhat\\nexclusive in germany, though its hierarchical\\nsystem is becoming easier to enter. in elemen-\\ntary school, children take an exam that divides\\nthem into one of three schools: gymnasium;\\nrealschule or hauptschule. only gymnasium is\\nauniversity-preparatory school.\\n\\ngymnasium has become more accessible\\nover the past few decades. according to ger-\\nman data portal statista, 15 percent of students\\nin 1952 were in gymnasium. by 2005, it was 33\\npercent.\\n\\nthe increasingly open doors of the gym-\\nnasium have caused a strain on universities\\nthe past decade and a half, canning said. pro-\\nfessorships are few. in the frieburg history\\ndepartment, for instance, canning said there\\n\\nwere nine history professors. the university\\nof michigan has 90.\\n\\n“there’s a second tier of what they call\\nmid-career instructors who, however, have no\\njob security and they’re not even permanent\\nlecturers like you would have here,” canning\\nadded. “they’re often filling in or actually\\nteaching for free while hoping to get a profes-\\nsorship somewhere else.”\\n\\njohannes von moltke, associate profes-\\nsor and chair of german, said, “there’s over-\\n\\ncrowding in german universities. because it’s\\nreally accessible, a lot of people study.”\\n\\nrackham student cristian capotescu\\nreceived his history degree from the univer-\\nsity of freiburg in 2010. lectures are not so\\ndifferent in german schools than in the u.s.,\\ncapotescu described, with packed lecture\\nhalls of hundreds of students.\\n\\nwhere differences existed were in semi-\\nnars and tutorials, the latter being something\\nlike a class section with a greater emphasis on\\nlearning how to better write, read, etc. capo-\\ntescu said graduate students often teach semi-\\nnars, whereas here professors almost always\\nlead them. stranger yet, undergraduates are\\nwont to teach these tutorials.\\n\\n“the quality of those sections are a lot\\nlower,” capotescu said. “i certainly think\\ngraduate students are more qualified to teach\\nthose sections, but is it worth $40,000 a year?”\\n\\nthe ban on tuition in germany was lifted in\\n2006. following that, various german states\\nbegan issuing small semester fees to better its\\nquality of education. canning said the hugely\\nunpopular tuition actually did not help condi-\\ntions at university.\\n\\n“either they just conceded that it wasn’t\\nenough money to really do anything and it was\\ntoo controversial to even bother with it,” can-\\nning said.\\n\\ncapotescu agreed that 500 euros ($624.95)\\n\\nper semester was unlikely to break the bank;\\nhowever, the implementation of tuition on\\nprinciple could later prove difficult.\\n\\n“there’s always the possibility that it could\\nbe increased,” capotescu said. “we saw that\\nin the u.s. that once higher tuition was intro-\\nduced it kept increasing.”\\n\\nin 2012, the average debt of a university\\ngraduate was nearly $28,000, with 44 per-\\ncent of the student body graduating with debt.\\nmoreover, while the german government\\n\\nluna anna archey/daily\\ncontinues invest money in education, a mere 16\\npercent of the university’s budget come from\\nstate appropriations.\\n\\n“the money we need grows and the money\\nwe get shrinks,” von moltke said.\\n\\nas recently as 1990, state funding and\\ntuition contributed equally to the budget.\\n\\ncapotescu noted issues with a huge student\\nbody, not unlike germany.\\n\\n“we assume that with american educa-\\ntion, you pay so much so it’s better. when you\\nlook closer at elite public higher education at\\nschools like michigan, it’s not a perfect world\\nor utopia,” capotescu said. “you still have 150\\nstudents ina lecture.”\\n\\nthe increased tuition did encourage a state\\nof mind that does not exist in germany. amer-\\nican college students view themselves as con-\\nsumers at the university; we spend a certain\\namount of money and expect a certain qual-\\nity of service. german collegiates, though, are\\n“student-citizens,” von moltke explained.\\n\\nfor instance, career advising is more or less\\nnon-existent in germany. students can use\\ngovernment offices for these things. in fact,\\nmost services like housing and public trans-\\nportation for students are provided by the city\\nor state.\\n\\n“its job is to serve the public, not to treat its\\nstudents as clients,” von moltke said. “for bet-\\nter and for worse, in the u.s., you are a paying\\n\\nclient and because of the way american capi-\\ntalism works, customer service is part of the\\nexperience... of course it kind of commodifies\\neducation. it becomes a good to be exchanged\\nbetween a seller and buyer. whereas in ger-\\nmany, the ideal is still it’s a public good so\\nyou’re not paying or buying for it, you’re taking\\nadvantage of your right to education. but then\\nit isn’t kind of fenced in with all of these con-\\nsumer bells and whistles.”\\n\\nthat lack-of-consumer model is also\\nreflected in the type of education students can\\n\\nexpect. canning described three types of\\nclasses: lectures and small, introductory and\\nadvanced seminars.\\n\\na first-year student in an introductory\\nseminar on the french revolution, canning\\ndescribed, would be expected to already\\nknow the chronology of the revolution, or\\nreceive suggestions for background reading.\\nthe course would focus on reading primary\\nsources — in french — and discussing them.\\n\\nstudents in lecture courses rarely have\\nperformance-based measurements, like\\nquizzes or tests, at the end. instead, stu-\\ndents ask to take an oral exam with a profes-\\nsor if they feel they know the material well\\nenough.\\n\\n“if you bomb, it’s your own fault and no\\none cares,” canning said. “there’s nobody\\nthere to hold your hand. it’s up to you. you’re\\na scholar, you’re at the university because\\nyou want to actually learn. our little ‘holding\\nout the carrot’ just doesn’t happen.”\\n\\nlsa junior alexandra trecha, who is\\nstudying in freiburg this year, noticed the\\n\\ndifference in expectations.\\n\\n“there definitely isn’t as much ‘checking in’\\nand students are expected to be much more\\nresponsible and invested in their work here\\ncompared to the u.s.,” trecha said.\\n\\nat the university, students expect, well,\\neverything from their college experience. the\\nuniversity provides transportation, housing,\\nfood, libraries, mental health support, aca-\\ndemic and career advising and — perhaps most\\nimportantly — a social scene.\\n\\nin the u.s., the college years are supposed\\nto be “the best time” of your life. germans see\\ncollege as a continuation of one’s education,\\nas momentous as moving from tenth to 11th\\ngrade. more fanfare surrounds moving away\\nfrom home.\\n\\n“tt’s not the place you go and get away from\\nyour parents for four years and drink and fig-\\nure out who you are,” canning said.\\n\\ncapotescu noted that much soul-searching\\nand deciding what one’s talents are occurs in\\nhigh school. indeed, hopeful doctors in ger-\\nmany attend medical or law school directly\\nafter high school rather than dabbling in biol-\\nogy courses for two years before deciding to\\nmajor in philosophy.\\n\\n“college is a lot more functional,” capo-\\ntescu said. “you go through university to get\\nto ajob.”\\n\\nto read more visit michigandaily.com\\n',\n",

we shared our deepest\\nsecrets and fears and dreams with\\neach other and never, ever ran out of\\nthings to talk about. in this friend-\\nship, i found a deeper level of emo-\\ntional intimacy than anything i had\\never shared with another person. she\\nwas the best friend that i’d ever had.\\n\\nwith all the similarities that\\nallowed us to become such close\\nfriends, we were also incredibly dif-\\nferent. she was outgoing, where i\\nwas reserved; she loved taking pho-\\ntographs, i loved to write. she was\\nconfident and sure of herself while i\\nworried too much about what others\\nthought of me. ultimately, the news-\\npaper gave me this relationship. we\\nbonded over the ridiculous amounts\\nof time we devoted to our publica-\\ntions. the school yearbook contin-\\nued to win awards, while the school\\nnewspaper struggled to stay alive.\\nregardless, we both did a lot of our\\ngrowing up ina computer lab.\\n\\nwe kissed for the first time while\\nwe were watching a documentary on\\nseptember 11. by this point, i was fill-\\ning out college applications and had\\nbeen promoted to editor in chief of\\nthe now-monthly newspaper. she\\nwas a freshman in college and had\\nmoved several hours from home. it\\nseemed like everything had changed\\nsince i was a sophomore, but our\\nfriendship endured it all.\\n\\nby carolyn gearig\\n\\ni'll never forget that moment. to\\nthis day, i don’t know who started it.\\nwhat i do know is that i enjoyed it,\\nit was completely unexpected and it\\nhit me straight in the head with no\\nwarning.\\n\\nthe following week was perhaps\\nthe scariest time of my life. i had no\\nidea what was happening: my world\\nwas turned upside down. one week i\\nconsidered myself to be straight and\\nher to be my best friend; the next,\\neverything was different. the idea\\nof my friendship changing scared me\\nshitless. she was the only one i want-\\ned to talk to, yet she was the root of\\nmy insecurities.\\n\\nso began the coming out pro-\\ncess: something i still can’t stand. i\\nhave never been ashamed or embar-\\nrassed of my sexuality — whatever\\nit is — but i hate the act of telling. i\\nfeel like it is oftentimes similar to the\\nfact that i have always worn glasses:\\nsomething that is important to me, in\\nsome ways, but mostly just a part of\\nwho i am. i hate coming out because\\nit makes me feel so vulnerable: what\\nis to most people an afterthought is,\\nto me, deeply personal. at the time, i\\nhad no idea how to define my sexuali-\\nty, unwilling to classify it as anything\\nother than “not straight.” i hated\\nit, because i felt like i had to define\\nit, though i wasn’t sure what that\\ndefinition was. i hated it, because of\\nmy friends never had to come out as\\nstraight. coming out to each person\\npresented a unique, complicated bat-\\ntle with myself.\\n\\nafter a lot of discussion and deep\\nthinking, we decided to make our\\nrelationship official, but i had no\\none to share the happy news with.\\ninstead, we started together on a\\npath to self-discovery. i realized\\nmore and more, as every minute went\\nby, how strongly i had felt towards\\nher. though i previously had crushes\\non boys, it was nothing compared to\\nthe way i felt when she walked into a\\nroom. everything i had ever done, i\\nwanted to do with her.\\n\\nour relationship didn’t survive\\nmy senior year of high school, but\\nsometimes i wonder if she would\\nstill be in my life had we been in a\\nboy-girl relationship. the pressures\\nthat came from falling in love while\\nkeeping it a secret and coming to\\nterms with my own sexuality were\\nimmense. this put pressures on our\\nrelationship that no one should have\\nto face. and being several hours\\napart only made it that much worse.\\n\\nlooking back, all the signs were\\nthere. we were close in a way i had\\nnever been with any of my friends.\\nbut i had always identified as\\nstraight. coming to terms with this\\nchange in my identity was a process\\ni still struggle with day in and day\\nout. i have learned that sexuality is\\na spectrum and is not as black and\\nwhite as i previously thought.\\n\\nluckily, i had several people\\nwho stood by me throughout the\\nordeal, and for that i cannot thank\\nthem enough. i am blessed with\\nopen-minded friends and family who\\n\\ngnvtiohtinw nvoaw ad noilvalsntii\\n\\naccepted and loved me for who i am.\\nwithout these people, i don’t know\\nhow i would have made it through.\\nfor those who i didn’t tell until after\\nthe fact, i was sorry. trust me when\\ni say that keeping it a secret wasn’t\\nwhat i wanted.\\n\\nultimately, am i glad it hap-\\npened? our four months of happiness\\nmeant more than i can say, but losing\\nher as a friend because of it was sad-\\nder than i can possibly describe. but\\nin the process, i learned an incredible\\namount about who i was and what i\\nwanted from the rest of my life.\\n\\nnow, i work 20 hours a week\\nfor a newspaper with a legitimate\\nbudget and a circulation of 15,000.\\ni’m dating a boy. my high school\\nself wouldn’t recognize me now. i’m\\nhappier than i’ve ever been but i am\\noften reminded of how much easier\\nmy second relationship is over the\\nfirst. i’ve never hesitated to hold his\\nhand in public and i don’t have to\\nthink twice when telling new friends\\nand acquaintances that i have a boy-\\nfriend. ’m more aware than ever of\\nthe privileges i have when i am with\\nhim, and they are mind-blowing in\\ncomparison. and it makes me sad.\\nkeeping her a secret hurt more than\\nanything.\\n\\nif we were given a chance, who\\nknows what would have happened?\\nshe might still be in my life;

anything you see\\nor hear on the news is just hearsay at this\\npoint. so before this opportunity slips away\\nfrom me, i am officially announcing myself as\\na candidate for the athletic director position\\nat the university of michigan.\\n\\nbefore i get written off as unqualified, let\\nme explain. mr. hackett, feel free to use this\\nas acover letter if it suits you.\\n\\nat the press conference, schlissel said the\\nnew athletic director must be “a person of\\nunquestioned integrity, not just integrity to\\nthe level of ncaa rules.”\\n\\nfor starters, i’ve never allegedly e-mailed\\nan alumnus passive-aggressively telling them\\nto “have a happy life” or “stop drinking and go\\nto bed.”\\n\\nsecond, one of my professors referred to\\nme as a “great guy” in office hours. if those\\ntwo examples don’t represent “unquestioned\\nintegrity,” i’m not sure what does. however,\\nfor those still unconvinced about my qualifi-\\ncations, please read on.\\n\\nif you’re worried about my leadership\\nskills, there’s nothing to fear. six people\\nhave endorsed me on linkedin for “leader-\\nship,” and admittedly, i’m pretty proud of\\nthat. small sample size, yes. but i know those\\npeople didn’t hesitate for a second when\\nthey hit the endorse button. that counts for\\nsomething.\\n\\nif you’re looking for someone who knows a\\nthing or two about generating sales and build-\\ning a brand, look no further. i have more than\\n530 followers on twitter — although most of\\nthem think i play for the denver broncos. in\\nthe business, we call that a dedicated follow-\\ning. in my younger days, i ran some pretty\\nsuccessful lemonade stands. and i never once\\nconsidered raising the price to maximize rev-\\nenue because i didn’t want the community\\n\\nderek\\nwolfe\\n\\nrobert schwarzhaupt |\\n\\nto lose faith in me. a 25-cent glass, now and\\nforever. to top it off, ’ve never sold terrible\\npizza. i think that wins a few h.a.i.l. points.\\n\\nschlissel also mentioned that the next\\nathletic director doesn’t have to have\\nmichigan ties. he reiterated this point in an\\ninterview with the daily on monday, “i’m\\nalways open to the idea that someone from\\nthe outside might help us be even better. i just\\nwant to get the best person.”\\n\\nclearly, this is where i’m at a little bit of\\na disadvantage. i am a “michigan man”\\nafter all — if having a university e-mail\\naccount makes you one. however, i contend\\ni would bring a nice balance to the athletic\\ndepartment.\\n\\nfirst off, i never played for legendary\\nfootball coach bo schembechler. in fact, i\\nnever played football. that being said, i’ve still\\nsucceeded in athletics. though you might not\\nbe able tell by looking at me, i was an integral\\nmember of a championship basketball team\\non my hometown’s local recreational league\\n— there were only seven players and my dad\\nwas the coach. for this, i am, and will always\\nbe, a winner. sure, the last guy may have had\\nthree big ten championship rings, but ’m\\nalso confident i got more playing time than\\nhe did.\\n\\nwhile i’ve never worked in an athletic\\ndepartment before, i’ve been to my fair\\nshare of football and basketball games. that\\nshould suffice. i’m also proficient in addition\\nand subtraction so the budget stuff is no\\nbig deal. also, in case you forgot, i’ve run a\\nlemonade stand before. can you say business\\nexperience?\\n\\ni would bring a solid understanding of the\\nstudent voice. heck, when i want student\\ninput on an issue all i’ll

the new inclusive\\nlanguage campaign kicking off, it’s time we\\nmake sure to keep things in perspective. first\\nof all, i want to recognize my place of privilege\\nin this area. i am a white presenting, middle\\nclass, cisgender male who largely does not face\\nthe mounting burden of micro-aggressions.\\nas always, it is important to keep that in mind\\nas i only face micro-aggressions for my queer\\nidentity, which does play a role in how i view\\nthis topic. however, i’d like to move forward\\nas a student of social science, which will\\ninform my thoughts.\\n\\nthe more social justice circles that i’ve nav-\\nigated through, the more i have come across\\na fixation on making sure language is inclu-\\nsive. people actively make an effort to correct\\neach other in order to make sure their diction\\nis properly inclusive. and while this prac-\\ntice is valuable, and certainly necessary, i am\\nbeginning to worry. yes, language has a pow-\\nerful effect in perpetuating unfair and unjust\\nsystems, dynamics and institutions. yes, lan-\\nguage can be powerfully racist, sexist, bigoted\\nand unintentionally hateful. yes, language is\\na subtle and subversive form of problematic\\nconditioning. and yes, understanding and cor-\\nrecting problematic language is one step in\\ncreating an equitably functional society. how-\\never, this newly growing modern view of strict\\ninclusive language is proving more and more\\ndangerous. simply put, this massive amount\\nof energy focused on only inclusive language\\nin social justice spaces convinces people social\\njustice issues can be fixed simply by applying\\nstrict scrutiny to our words. monitoring lan-\\nguage to be more inclusive, while comforting,\\nactually does very little to help fix the larger\\noppressive macro-systems and institutions\\nthat plague america and fuel injustice. rath-\\ner, inclusive language can be used to create a\\nspace where interpersonal dialogue may lead\\nto generating potential solutions to larger\\n\\nsocial problems. inclusive language is simply\\none method to facilitate the creation of spaces\\nwhere diversity is at the center of the dialogue.\\nhowever, in and of itself, inclusive language\\ndoes very little to solve the larger problems\\nthat fuel injustice in society on a mass scale.\\n\\nbefore i go on, i would like to be clear that\\nmaking people comfortable in social settings\\nis very important. however, let’s not conflate\\nthis with fixing systemic injustice. this\\nmodern fixation on strict scrutiny of language,\\nwhile well-intentioned, takes the focus away\\nfrom realities of fixing our larger society and\\nthe complex tasks associated with it. fixing\\nsocial justice issues will require complex\\nadvocacy, coalition-building, research and\\na real understanding of social dynamics,\\npsychology and politics. it is unfortunate\\nthat policing language is where social justice\\nstarts and ends from many people, because\\nit does nothing to help the real, pressing\\nneeds. the modern practice of language\\npolicing to be “inclusive” fails to recognize\\nthe social politics of interpersonal education,\\nmotivating political support and coalition-\\nbuilding. simply put, it turns many people\\naway from social justice issues in a way that\\ndoes nothing to build support or solve them.\\n\\nagain, let me be clear in saying that\\npeople should be held accountable to their\\nwords. language has a real effect on social\\ninteractions, and everyone should strive to\\nunderstand how their language can make\\npeople feel, but we should be wary on its actual\\nefficacy in solving the problems that have\\nhuge effects on people’s lives such as cyclical\\npoverty and the achievement gap.\\n\\nultimately, policing language is a subtle form\\nof slacktivism and does very little in creating\\nactual change in the way marginalized groups\\nare institutionally oppressed.\\n\\nrobert schwarzhaupt is an lsa senior\\nand a programming board member in\\nthe trotter multicultural center.\\n\\nwhen i abandoned beauty for strength\\n\\nwrong reasons.\\ni heard

and tips that detailed\\nhow to lift small weights to achieve\\nthe beauty ideal of the perfect\\nfemale celebrity. they all directed\\nme toward the same end goal — thin\\nand toned. alone with these voices,\\ni had become fogged by the pursuit\\nof changing my body beyond its\\nnormal form.\\n\\ncreating my exercise plan started\\nwith opening the expanding pull-\\nouts from the middle of women’s\\nmagazines. each pull-out displayed\\na sequence of exercises done by\\nwispy white women. they had no\\nsweat, no creases, no fat and were\\nholding only two-pound weights.\\na tv remote could have replaced\\nthe weights they happily clutched.\\nnowhere had i seen images\\nof women lifting weights that\\n\\ndemanded real strength.\\n\\nthough i consumed these images\\nwholeheartedly, they sent me dan-\\ngerous messages. they informed me\\nthat lifting weights should be done,\\nironically, to not gain visible mus-\\ncles. they told me that i should not\\nbe “bulky” or “big” or “muscular.”\\nthey led me to believe that i should\\nwant the opposite. i should not want\\nto inhabit three-dimensional space.\\ni should want to be thin and lean\\nenough, so i appeared defenseless.\\n\\nbesides the visible messages that\\nthe fitness media was imparting, i\\nfound underlying lessons between\\nthe aspiration of thigh gaps. they\\ntold me that by consuming less\\nspace, i would receive more love and\\nworth. the areas my body left blank\\ncould be filled with more points on\\nan attractiveness scale designed by\\nmen. as i peered into the images\\nof perfectly toned women in\\nfitness magazines, i saw their eyes\\nhinting to me that a woman’s body\\nshould never reveal real power nor\\nintimidate men. it was hard to look\\naway. their stare was gripping, and\\nsoon i came to see what they saw.\\n\\neach day, i followed the sequenc-\\nes that were supposed to burn more\\ncalories than cardio. i religiously\\ndid very little weight at high rep-\\netition in order to build leanness\\ninstead of big muscles. the fear of\\nbecoming unattractive sustained\\nmy resistance of looking strong.\\nsoon weightlifting became some-\\nthing i did for others — to allow oth-\\ners to find me attractive and worthy.\\n\\nafter months of revisiting the\\nsame routines and the same corners\\nof the gym, i still was very removed\\nfrom the body i was promised. and\\ni was exhausted. i was exhausted by\\n\\nthe need to constantly adhere to one\\nideal and to exercise feebly. i decid-\\ned to listen to my exhaustion and to\\nabandon what i was supposed to do.\\nas i wished to switch to new rou-\\ntines, i found very little knowledge\\non how a woman can become strong\\ninstead of beautiful.\\n\\nmy journey to find new ways\\nof lifting weights led me to see\\nthe obvious.\\n\\nit’s no wonder that so many\\nwomen of all ages wish to adhere to\\na singular beauty ideal. and it’s no\\nwonder most women believe they\\nwill become massive bodybuilders if\\nthey begin to lift weights. and it’s no\\nwonder that the image of a woman\\nbodybuilder is unattractive, because\\nof its “threatening” demeanor to\\nmen. and it’s no wonder that there\\nis little knowledge circulating\\nwomen’s minds on how to safely\\nand properly lift weights. and it’s\\nno wonder that the free weight\\nsection of every gym lacks women\\nwhile men are overpopulating\\n\\nit. and it’s no wonder i was\\nafraid to ignore norms by\\nbecoming strong.\\n\\nand it’s no wonder when a\\nwoman’s worth is labeled by her\\nneed for the strength of men.\\n\\nafter learning the hidden\\nobviousness, i let my strength truly\\nreveal itself. i let my body move\\ntoward the gravitational pull it\\ndesired. i longed to be strong for\\nmyself and

health\\norganization announced its\\nrecommendation for all men who\\nhave sex with men (msm) to begin\\ntaking antiretroviral drugs as a\\nprecaution to combat the spread of\\nhiv/aids worldwide. this came\\nas a shock to many americans who\\nin recent years haven’t read or\\nheard many news stories about the\\nhiv/aids epidemic.\\n\\nsince the initial hiv/aids\\nepidemic started in the 1980s, rates\\nof hiv transmission in the united\\nstates have generally remained\\nstable. according to the centers for\\ndisease control, it’s estimated that\\n1.1 million americans are living\\nwith hiv, and that one out of six\\ndon’t know that they have hiv.\\n\\nthe group in the united states\\nthat remains most affected by hiv/\\naids is msm. hiv infection in\\nthe united states has declined in\\nevery group except gay/bisexual\\nmen. rates of hiv infection have\\nactually been increasing among\\nthis group. from 2008 to 2010,\\nthe rate of new hiv infections for\\nmsm climbed 12 percent. in 2010,\\nmsm made up approximately 4\\npercent of the u.s. population, but\\naccounted for 63 percent of all new\\nhiv infections.\\n\\nin 2010, women accounted for 20\\npercent of all new hiv infections,\\nand 84 percent of these were\\nattributed to heterosexual contact.\\nin that same year, “white msm\\ncontinued to account for the largest\\nnumber of new hiv infections,”\\naccording to the cdc.\\n\\ntherearetwostigmasat playhere:\\nthe assumption in the heterosexual\\npopulation that hiv/aids is a gay\\n\\ndisease, and the assumption in the\\nwhite msm population that hiv/\\naids is a disease associated with\\nminority msm. the mainstream\\nmedia today portrays hiv/aids\\nin the gay community or in iv\\ndrug users. people assume that as\\nlong as they aren’t having sex with\\npeople from these communities\\nthat their risk for hiv isn’t very\\nhigh. these stigmas, along with the\\nlack of a legitimate sex education,\\nthen lead to unsafe sex and not\\nbeing regularly tested for sexually\\ntransmitted infections. in order to\\nstop this unsafe trend, the myths\\n\\nsurrounding hiv/aids must\\nbe dispelled.\\none-fourth of new hiv\\n\\ninfections occur in youth ages 13\\nto 24; most of those infected are\\nunknowing, not getting tested/\\ntreated and potentially infecting\\nmore people. hiv after contraction\\nmay or may not produce symptoms.\\nwithin two to four weeks after the\\ninitial exposure, people may feel\\nflu-like symptoms, but eventually\\nthese symptoms subside.\\n\\nmany people will live years\\nbefore being diagnosed with hiv\\nor aids. in a campus survey our\\nprogram on intergroup relations\\nclass group conducted, only 20\\npercent of respondents have been\\ntested for stis in the last three\\nmonths, and of that 20 percent only\\n11 percent were also tested for hiv.\\ncommon responses for not being\\ntested were that no symptoms are\\npresent, or that respondents did\\nnot think that they were at risk.\\nanother common response was the\\nstigma that goes along with being\\ntested for hiv. respondents didn’t\\n\\nwant their doctors to think they\\nwere gay or having risky sex. this\\nis especially true for bisexual men\\nwho, because of society, choose not\\nto get tested and not to tell partners\\nabout their encounters with men.\\nthe misconceptions around campus\\nabout hiv/aids are apparent.\\n\\nhiv/aids affects people indis-\\ncriminately, and although the only\\nsure way to avoid contracting hiv\\nis through abstinence, there are\\nmany ways to greatly reduce your\\nrisk. these include using latex or\\npolyurethane = condoms/barriers,\\nusing water-based lubricant, ask-\\ning your partner about their sexual\\nhistory, avoiding alcohol or drugs as\\nthey alter the decision-making and\\nchoosing lower-risk sexual activi-\\nties. frequent sti screenings (that\\ninclude hiv) are also essential.\\nalthough hiv/aids is most promi-\\nnent today in the msm and african\\namerican community, all sexually\\nactive people are at risk. especially\\nwhen involved with casual sex part-\\nners who may not have been tested\\nthemselves, or may have lied about\\ntheir sexual histories. sleeping with\\nsomeone is like sleeping with every-\\none that they’ve ever slept with too.\\n\\ntransmission of hiv is fully\\npreventable; most of the new cases\\ncontracted are due to a lack of\\nknowledge and lack of precaution.\\nthere are many great resources in\\nann arbor for both sti testing and\\nsafe sex. for more information about\\nsti testing and hiv/aids statistics,\\nplease visit the cdc

politics aside and instead\\nuse his business acumen to\\nimprove the state appealed\\nto voters, as he sailed to an\\n18-point victory over demo-\\ncrat virg bernero.\\n\\n“it’s time to drop the labels\\n... of party, of ideology, of geog-\\nraphy,” snyder said in his 2010\\nvictory speech. “to make this\\nwork there is only one label\\n\\nthat matters. that label is\\n\\nwant to have quality

instead optimistic that the\\nstate could overcome political\\nbarriers to work together.\\n\\n“we can raise the standard\\nof how politics should operate\\nin this country,” he said.\\n\\nyet his smaller margin of\\nvictory four years later may\\nreflect criticisms that he too\\noften broke from his promise\\nto avoid promoting partisan\\nissues.\\n\\n“there were some things\\nthat happened in (snyder)’s\\nfirst term that showed he\\ncould be quite political, so he\\ndidn’t have the same kind of\\nindependent persona that he\\n\\nsupport for president barack\\n\\nobama and the auto

democrats, that is what\\nwe have stood for since day one\\nand we will continue to stand\\nfor days in the future.”\\n\\nwhile some candidates have\\nsought to distance themselves\\nfrom obama and his policies,\\none prominent one in michigan\\nbeing the auto bailout, peters\\nhas not. he was the only senate\\ncandidate to have the president\\n\\nby the principle of conservative\\nfiscal policy.\\n\\ncunningham said being a\\nconservative in left-leaning ann\\narbor is difficult.\\n\\n“i really wish that i could\\nbe much more open about my\\npolitical views and i wish that\\npeople would be more willing\\nto dialogue with me because i\\nthink we have so much more in\\ncommon with democrats, espe-\\ncially as young republicans,\\nthan most people think we do,”\\nshe said.\\n\\nlsa senior gabe leaf, chair\\nof the university’s chapter of\\nthe college republicans, said\\nhe was chiefly concerned with\\nreducing unemployment and\\nexpanding michigan’s economy.\\nhis vote for snyder stemmed\\nfrom the governor’s gradual\\nincreases in funding higher edu-\\ncation.\\n\\n“he’s a michigan man him-\\nself,” leaf said. “he comes from\\nus; he knows what we’ve been\\nthrough, the kind of struggles\\nare for higher education to oper-\\nate, and he’s also a businessman\\nso he knows how to run these\\nthings more effectively.”\\n\\nlsa junior stephen culbert-\\nson, communications director\\nfor college democrats, said he\\nbelieved the democratic party\\nhad a better understanding of\\n\\ndid in the first election, and\\nthat cost him the mobilized\\ndemocrats,” political science\\nprof. mike traugott said in an\\ninterview with the michigan\\ndaily.\\n\\nin the legislature’s lame\\nduck session in december\\n2012, snyder signed right-to-\\nwork legislation into law, out-\\nlawing union requirements\\nfor members to pay dues as\\na condition of employment.\\nthe\\nsnyder signed a measure ban-\\n\\nfollowing december,\\n\\nning abortion coverage from\\nprivate health plans, instead\\nrequiring women who wanted\\nsuch a plan to purchase sup-\\nplemental insurance. he has\\nalso declined to take a per-\\nsonal stance on gay marriage,\\nchoosing instead to defer to\\nthe pending decision in feder-\\n\\nhost a rally for him this election\\nseason.\\n\\nin the night’s other big race,\\ndemocrats were less successful;\\nincumbent governor rick sny-\\nder (r) held onto his seat. peters\\nsaid, as state representative, he\\nhas already worked with sny-\\nder on building a new bridge\\nbetween the u.s. and canada.\\n\\n“it’s a project that i think is\\n\\neducation issues. he also appre-\\nciated u.s. representative-elect\\ndebbie dingell’s advocacy for\\nmichigan jobs and women’s\\nissues.\\n\\nal appeals court on the state’s\\n\\nban on same-sex marriage.\\nthe\\n\\nattempted to\\n\\nschauer campaign\\ndifferentiate\\nfrom snyder on those issues,\\nand argued that the

funding\\nin his first budget — though\\nboth funds have increased in\\neach of the budgets since.\\n\\nin a concession speech\\ntuesday night, schauer reiter-\\nated his commitment to those\\nissues.\\n\\n“we fought hard,” he told\\nthe crowd. “we left it all on the\\nfield. we made this race about\\nour kids, about seniors, about\\nour middle class, about work-\\n\\nvitally important for the state of\\nmichigan, really for the whole\\ncountry, to increase trade\\nbetween the u.s and canada\\nand i’ve worked with governor\\nsnyder on that, and should he\\nbe successful tonight we’ll con-\\ntinue to work together,” peters\\ntold the media on working\\ntogether with snyder before the\\nrace was called.\\n\\n“while some of the results\\nare a bit disappointing, there is a\\nlot to look forward to with gary\\npeters and debbie dingell in\\nwashington,” he said. ”i think\\n\\ning people.”\\n\\nhe said he was disappoint-\\ned, but not discouraged, by the\\nresults.\\n\\n“this was not just about\\n2014,” he said. “this was a\\nmovement about the future of\\nour state. ifi learned one thing\\nduring this campaign, it’s that\\nthe people of michigan never\\ngive up. when we get knocked\\ndown, we get right back up.\\nfor me, this campaign is over.\\nbut for all of us as democrats,\\nas michiganders who love our\\ngreat state, this work must and\\nwill continue.”\\n\\ncollege republicans presi-\\ndent gabe leaf, an lsa senior,\\nsaid he has been happy with\\nsnyder’s work in higher educa-\\ntion, despite public criticism.\\n\\n“he’s really putting a focus\\non education,” leaf said. “he’s\\n\\nhe will join u.s senator deb-\\nbie stabenow (d-mi), now the\\nstate’s senior senator, in con-\\ngress. in replacing levin, peters\\ntold the media that he would\\nseek to continue expressing the\\nvalues levin brought to the job.\\n\\n“i look forward...to serv-\\ning in the senate, building up\\nseniority and doing the hard\\nwork necessary for michigan\\n\\nthey can represent michigan\\nvery well. they will be tremen-\\ndous advocates for michigan-\\nders and the middle class, so\\nthat’s a big bright spot tonight.”\\n\\na michigan man himself so he\\ncomes from us, he knows what\\nwe’ve been through, the kind\\nof struggles are for higher edu-\\ncation to operate and he’s also\\na businessman, so he knows\\nhow to run these things more\\neffectively.”\\n\\ninclosing his victory speech\\ntuesday night, snyder made a\\ncommitment to carry over the\\nenergy of reinvention into his\\nsecond term.\\n\\n“the passion, the fire, the\\nexcitement, the conviction to\\ndo the reinvention that you’ve\\nseen this tuesday, i’m going to\\nhave it on wednesday, thurs-\\nday, friday and for the next\\nfour years,” snyder said.\\n\\ndaily staff reporter shoham\\n\\ngeva and emma_ kinery\\n\\ncontributed reporting.\\n\\nand that means being a prac-\\ntical, common sense problem\\nsolver,” he said. “the thing\\nabout

karen hua\\ndaily arts writer\\n\\nthis past thursday, the\\niconic sitcom “two and a half\\nmen” premiered its twelfth and\\n\\nfinal season.\\n\\nthe show\\n\\nhistorically\\n\\nhas been one two and a\\nof the most\\n\\nbeloved and half men\\nhighly-rated on season 12\\ntelevision, but premiere\\n\\nin recent years\\nhasseenseveral thursdays\\n\\nups and downs. at9p.m.\\n\\nat this point,  ¢p5\\n\\nit seems like\\n\\ncbs continues\\n\\nto renew the show simply for\\nthe sake of tradition. while it\\nis true “men” has become a\\nsort of american legend, the\\nshow’s audience is waning and\\ndemonstrates little potential for\\ngrowth.\\n\\nnow with the absence of\\ncharlie (charlie sheen, “anger\\nmanagement”), many viewers\\nhave turned away, even with the\\nyounger, cleaner walden (ashton\\nkutcher, “no strings attached”)\\nas a substitute. with alan’s john\\ncryer, “pretty in pink”) brother\\ngone, and his son jake (angus\\nt. jones, “the rookie”) “in the\\narmy,” the show can only come\\nup with so many fresh premises\\nfor two grown male best friends\\nthat have not been used in sitcoms\\nbefore.\\n\\nthe title no longer makes sense,\\nas jake is now not only a legal\\nadult, but he is also absent in the\\npremiere. even though this will\\nbe its final season, “men” must\\nonly come up with a multitude of\\nexcuses for the disappearance of\\ncharacters as the show runs on\\ndiminishing possibilities.\\n\\nwhether or not the producers\\nlike it, they cannot stop the\\naudience from automatically\\ncomparing kutcher to sheen.\\nperhaps firing the volatile sheen\\nhelped their industry’s image, but\\nmany argue that the series should\\nhave wrapped up with sheen’s\\n\\nie\\n\\n[a\\n\\n“guess we'll just ride this one out...”\\n\\ndismissal. the original character\\ndynamic is simply unparalleled.\\nregardless of kutcher’s talent,\\nsheen still stands as the face of\\nthe show, as he has a #winning\\nstage presence that simply cannot\\nbe matched.\\n\\nthe premiere starts with\\nthe two men and missing half-\\nman, donned in their halloween\\n\\nbest. walden unexpectedly\\nsuffers a heart attack, and after\\nhis “terrifying” near-death\\n\\nexperience, he completely over-\\ndramatizes his dismay to where\\nhis “desperation” seems more like\\nsarcasm.\\n\\nthe premiere continues this\\npattern of amalgamating hilarious\\nmoments with artificial ones\\nto the point where the writing\\nsimply feels uncomfortable.\\nthere are far too many instances\\nwhen walden’s lines are so over-\\ndramatically presented that it is\\nambiguous whether he truly is\\ntrying to sarcastic or genuine.\\n\\nespecially when walden pokes\\nfun at alan, the jokes seemed\\nrehearsed and timed, without\\nthe spontaneity that is supposed\\nto qualify his character as witty.\\nthe humor becomes too cheesy,\\nespecially when it is ambiguous —\\nat least initially — whether walden\\nlegitimately has a heart attack or\\nwhether he fakes it for attention.\\n\\nduring walden’s contemplation\\nof his “purpose of existence,” he\\ndecides he wants to introduce a\\nchild in his life, which ironically\\ncontradicts his free-spirited\\npersona. he’s not supposed to be\\nthe one philosophizing to alan,\\nbut rather vice versa — another\\nstrange discontinuity in the\\npremiere.\\n\\nwalden is rejected from the\\nadoption agencies, however,\\nbecause his status as a single father\\nis unfavorable in comparison to\\n\\nrelease date- wednesday, november 5, 2014\\n\\nlos angeles times daily crossword

don’t see horrible\\nthings, i want to see them,\\nand architecture is like that.\\nit has to face the real stuff,\\nand any architecture that\\ndoesn’t is really missing the\\npoint.”\\n\\nunpaid interns, rented\\ndesks, large paycuts and\\nintensive layoffs were the\\nsacrifices the newspaper\\nhad to make in order to stay\\nafloat during the recession,\\nand in 2012, iovine finally\\nleft the publication as she\\nwas financially unable to stay\\nlonger.\\n\\n“in a fantastic way,\\narchitecture is really used\\nto this ‘boom-bust’ thing,”\\ntovine said. “(the recession)\\nwas a fascinating time to\\nlearn how to stay resilient\\nand dynamically inventive as\\narchitect’s are. they figure\\nout what they need to do to\\nget through, and that’s what\\nwe did. as we look back, it\\nwas actually quite a neat\\ntime.”\\n\\nbefore leaving the\\narchitect’s newspaper,\\niovine helped oversee a large\\ndigital expansion, including\\nlaunching a sleek website\\nas well as facebook and\\ntwitter platforms. iovine\\nnods at critics who question\\nhow such a physical art form\\ncan translate over a digital\\nplatform, yet she believes\\nthe advancements have been\\npositive for architecture.\\n\\n“it’s a good thing and a bad\\nthing. it draws even further\\narchitecture’s tendency to\\nbe a beauty contest, because\\nyou can just splash these\\n\\nspectacular photographs\\nonto the internet and that’s\\nwhat some people think\\n\\nit’s all about,” iovine said.\\n“however, it also fits itself\\nvery smoothly into the world\\nof internet visualization.\\n\\nas architecture has\\nevolved to accommodate\\nand embrace an eco-friendly\\nlandscape, iovine highlighted\\nthe factors that she takes\\ninto consideration during a\\ncritique of a new building, the\\nfoundation for what she does\\nat the wall street journal.\\nin her lecture, she brought\\nup examples of exceptional\\nworks of architecture, which\\nshe believes has changed the\\nfuture of the art.\\n\\n“t need to be able to figure\\nout what’s going on, and\\nwithout the architect telling\\nme. it’s important to me that\\nthe building tells me what’s\\nimportant, and that the space\\nis comprehensible to me just\\nas a user, not as someone who\\nhas just had the architect\\ndescribe it all,” iovine said.\\n“knowing the constraints\\nthat were on the project is\\nalso important, whether it\\nwas budget, or political or\\nzoning issues. people see\\nthese things and may judge\\nit as horrible, but they don’t\\nknow why it’s horrible. it may\\nbe that the community had a\\n\\nstake in it.”\\niovine gave advice to\\ntaubman students looking\\n\\nto break into the competitive\\nworld of architecture, from\\nthe point of view of someone\\nwhose critiques can truly\\nchange public opinion\\nregarding an artist and their\\nbuildings.\\n\\n“you have to be absolutely\\ndevoted,” iovine said. “you\\nmust be ready to join the cult\\nbefore you take that leap,\\nand if you do it can be very\\nrewarding.”\\n\\nin terms of the ever-\\nchanging world of niche\\narts journalism, tovine\\nurged national publications\\nto retain their arts writers\\nand to keep informing and\\nshaping public opinion.\\n\\n“(arts journalism) will\\nthrive, but i worry that it\\nwill only thrive among an\\ninside track and close in on\\nitself,” iovine said. “the gap\\nwill grow between how the\\nwider public understands\\nart and art journalists, and\\nnewspapers are dropping\\ntheir architecture columnists\\nleft and right — there’s only\\nsix architecture columnists\\nleft in national newspapers.\\nthis  shouldn’t be that\\nway. more newspapers and\\nmagazines should think\\nit’s important that there\\nbe someone on hand and\\ndescribe the world and how\\nit’s being shaped.”\\n\\ntaubman graduate student\\nbrooke dexter and taubman\\nsenior alyssa kargl run\\ndimensions, the — student\\narchitecture publication

that’s\\n\\nreally important to us is\\nshowcasing student work,\\nbut also including voices\\n\\nfrom outside sources that\\ninfluence the way students\\nthink,” dexter said. “for\\nexample, hearing (lovine)\\nsay that architects need to\\nsimplify their words when\\ntalking to  non-architects\\nis very interesting for us,\\nand helps the student work\\nstay relevant in the outside\\nworld.”\\n\\n“since (taubman students)\\ncome from the same\\narchitecture education,\\nsometimes while working we\\nbecome somewhat similar\\nminded,” kargl said. “we\\nsometimes get caught in a\\ncertain way of thinking or a\\ncertain way of learning, so\\nlectures like these are always\\nrefreshing, and offer a new\\nperspective.\\n\\n“it’s easy to get too focused\\non some small detail of your\\nproject that you are so stuck\\non,” dexter said. “when you\\ncome to lectures like these,\\nyou realize that architecture\\nis so much bigger than what\\nyow’re working on now,

quarterback\\ndevin gardner found himself\\nunder duress in the pocket. while\\ngoing through his progressions\\nbehind center, the fifth-year\\nsenior locked in on receiver\\namara darboh running a route\\nnear the right sideline.\\n\\njust as gardner let go of the\\nball, the hoosiers’ linebacker\\nin coverage jumped the route\\nand appeared to have the ball in\\nhis hands with an easy path to\\nthe end zone. instead, darboh\\nknocked the ball loose and\\nprevented the pick six.\\n\\n“i was kind of thinking ...\\nhit the arm cause i hear the\\n(defensive backs) coach say that\\nall the time. so i just kind of tried\\nto swipe and hit the arm and i’m\\nthankful he didn’t get the pick,”\\ndarboh said after the game.\\n\\ndarboh has been arguably the\\nbest-kept secret of michigan’s\\noffense this season. the receiver\\nput that talent on display against\\nindiana, leading the offense with\\nnine receptions for 107 yards and\\na 12-yard touchdown. it was the\\nfirst time the redshirt sophomore\\npassed the century mark in his\\ncareer.\\n\\nall season, darboh has been\\ngardner’s favorite target behind\\njunior devin funchess. but\\nwith funchess usually receiving\\ndouble, sometimes triple,\\ncoverage, gardner has slowly\\ngrown a rapport with darboh,\\nwho has 26 catches for 362 yards\\nand two touchdowns on the\\nseason. two-hundred-fourteen\\nyards of that production have\\ncome in the last three games.\\n\\n“t think, for me, it’s the more\\ni play the more i get used to the\\ngame,” darboh said saturday.\\n“and feel it out and feel what the\\ndefensive backs are doing and feel\\nout where to be, and i think the\\nmore i play, the more experience\\n\\nr\\n\\ni’ve been getting.”\\n\\ndarboh got his first chance to\\nstart when redshirt sophomore\\njehu chesson was out with an\\ninjury against miami (hio)\\non sept. 13.\\nin that game\\ndarboh hauled\\nin a_ then-\\ncareer best six\\nreceptions for\\n88 yards. and\\nwhile chesson\\ngot the start\\nwith funchess\\nagainst\\nindiana, it was\\ndarboh who\\ngot most of the looks.\\n\\non michigan’s fourth offensive\\nplay of the day, gardner found\\ndarboh for a 34-yard completion\\n\\nb1g blues: struggles\\nare conference-wide\\n\\nby zach shaw\\ndaily sports writer\\n\\nit’s no secret the michigan\\nhockey team is struggling.\\n\\nafter opening the season\\nranked eighth in the nation, the\\nwolverines have stumbled to a\\n2-5 start, their worst in 28 years.\\n\\nbut michigan isn’t the only\\nbig ten team stumbling out of\\nthe gate. the daily gives a team-\\nby-team breakdown of what has\\ngone wrong (or right) for each\\nteam in the opening month.\\n\\nno. 1 minnesota (5-1):\\n\\none month ago, minnesota\\nwas one of three big ten teams\\nin the top-10. through six\\ngames, the golden gophers\\nare seventh in the nation with\\n3.67 goals per game and have\\nconverted 30.4-percent of\\npower-play opportunities, good\\nfor third in the nation.\\n\\nthere has been little to\\nquestion on the other side of\\nthe ice. minnesota’s eight nhl\\ndraftees on defense and junior\\ngoaltender adam _ wilcox,\\nreigning big ten player-of-\\nthe-year, have ensured that the\\ngolden gophers continue to\\nbe the nation’s most complete\\nteam. with a seemingly weak\\nbig ten, it’s hard to imagine\\nminnesota doing anything\\nshort of running the table in\\nconference play.\\n\\npenn state (5-1-2):\\n\\nlast season’s cellar-dwellers\\ngenerated plenty of momentum\\nwhen it upset michigan in last\\nseason’s big ten tournament.\\nthat momentum has continued\\nthis season. while much of the\\nbig ten has struggled, penn\\nstate has been a surprise starlet\\nin its second season as a varsity\\nprogram. scoring three or more\\ngoals in all but one game, the\\nnittany lions are third in the\\nnation in scoring, and have\\nmade sure to treat their fans —\\nwhich purchased all available\\nseason tickets in three minutes\\n— to entertaining hockey.\\n\\nohio state (2-3-1):\\n\\nafter splitting and largely\\noutplaying no. 12 providence\\nin its opening weekend and\\nvaulting into the rankings,\\nmany felt ohio state’s pieces\\nhad developed enough to avenge\\nlast season’s near-tournament\\nmiss.\\n\\nbut three straight losses\\ntempered expectations for the\\nbuckeyes, who are now 34th\\nin both offense and defense\\nand have shown little signs of\\nemerging from mediocrity.\\n\\nmichigan state (2-4):\\n\\nmichigan state was among\\nthe bottom five teams in\\nthe country in nearly every\\noffensive category last season.\\nthis year hasn’t been much\\ndifferent. with the exception\\nof forward matt berry, who\\nis seventh in the nation with\\nfive goals, the spartans have\\na dismal 13 goals through six\\ngames, have already been shut\\nout twice, are 2-for-28 on the\\npower play and have just five\\ngoals in their last four games.\\n\\ndespite the woes and poor\\nstart, michigan state has\\nshown it may not need to score\\nthat many goals to win down\\nthe road. led by goaltender\\njake hildebrand — among the\\nnation’s best netminders — the\\nspartans are allowing just two\\ngoals per game, with the clip\\nlowering to 1.25 against ranked\\nteams.\\n\\nwisconsin (0-4):\\n\\nof all the big ten teams\\ngoing through growing pains,\\nwisconsin has had it the worst.\\nafter opening the season 10th\\nin the country, the badgers\\nhave yet to win a game. with\\n13 freshmen, wisconsin limped\\nto two consecutive bye weeks\\nhaving scored just three goals,\\nfewest in the nation, and going\\n0-for-18 on the power play.\\n\\nit’s almost a given that\\nwisconsin will get better,\\nbut with 5-of-6 upcoming\\n\\ngames against ranked teams,\\nimprovement won’t necessarily\\ntranslate into wins.\\n\\n“the more i\\nplay, the more i\\nget used to the\\n\\ngame.”\\n\\nry\\n\\non a broken play that required\\nimprovisation from the receiver.\\nhe had to cut his route short as\\ngardner was pressured in the\\npocket. gardner then aired it out\\nto give darboh\\ntime to adjust\\nand get under\\nthe ball. the\\ntiming worked\\nand  darboh\\nmade the play.\\nafter seeing\\nselect time\\nduring his\\ntrue freshman\\nseason, mostly\\non special\\nteams, darboh sat out last season\\nafter sustaining a preseason foot\\ninjury. his return and subsequent\\nperformance this season has\\n\\nkept secret\\n\\nbi “ff __\\nq\\n\\nal f ” iz\\n\\npaul sherman/ daily\\nredshirt sophomore wide receiver amara darboh recorded a career-high nine receptions against indiana for 107 yards.\\n\\nbeen a welcome surprise for the\\nwolverines. it has been a season\\nof firsts for the des moines\\nnative, beginning with his first\\ncareer reception — a 26-yarder\\nagainst appalachian state in\\nweek one.\\n\\n“(darboh) works extremely\\nhard and it’s nice to see those\\nkinds of kids when they are\\nrewarded because of the hard\\nwork,” hoke said saturday.\\n“amara, you know we have devin\\non one side and amara on the\\nother, it maybe opens up some\\nthings a little better.”\\n\\nif funchess decides to forego\\nhis last season of eligibility for the\\nnfl draft, it could be darboh’s\\nshow next year. and after the last\\nfew games it appears he is more\\nthan up to the challenge.\\n\\nnovember 5, 2014 — 7a\\n\\nchatman stepping\\ninto starter’s role\\n\\nby jake lourim\\ndaily sports editor\\n\\nyes, michigan freshman\\nkameron chatman plays a very\\nsimilar style to former wolverine\\nglenn robinson iii. yes, he plays\\nthe same position as robinson\\ndid. and yes, robinson left that\\nspot open when he declared for\\nthe nba draft last spring.\\n\\nbut no, chatman is not looking\\nto replace robinson.\\n\\n“it wouldn't really compare\\nmyself to him,” he said thursday\\nat the team’s media day. “he was\\na great player, but i don’t really\\ngo out there and try to compare\\nmyself to him.”\\n\\nwhether he likes it or not,\\nchatman will be counted on at\\nleast sometimes this season to fill\\nthe void robinson left.\\n\\nchatman feels good about\\nhis basketball iq as he prepares\\nto play meaningful minutes\\nin his first season. michigan\\ncoach john beilein’s success at\\nturning freshman role players\\ninto sophomore stars has been\\nwell-documented, but chatman\\nthinks he’s ready to step in right\\naway.\\n\\nbeilein is still undecided on\\na possible starting lineup, but\\nchatman has the potential to fill\\nthat void. chatman is 6-foot-7,\\n210 pounds, robinson 6-foot-6,\\n220. chatman was the no. 38\\noverall recruit in the 2014 class\\nand was listed as asmall forward,\\nbut projects to be a stretch-four,\\nmuch like robinson.\\n\\n“he’s going to play both\\nforward positions as well, and if\\nwe ever got stuck, he could play\\nin the backcourt,” beilein said\\noct. 2 before the team opened\\npractice. “all of the freshmen are\\nok. what happens when we put\\ntwo or three weeks together?”\\n\\nthe wolverines have now\\n\\nput four weeks together, and\\nthursday at open practice,\\nchatman looked the part of a\\nstarter. he showed his length\\nand athleticism on both sides,\\nmuch like robinson did. he was\\nknocked around abit during mock\\ncontact drills, but he is already\\nlisted at 10 pounds heavier than\\nhe is in his recruiting profile.\\n\\nand despite the possible\\ndifference in physicality, he is\\nan inch taller with a wingspan\\nsimilar to robinson’s.\\n\\n“we saw early that he could be\\na rotation guy,” beilein said. “we\\nhave a rating system that we use\\nthat i won’t share with you, but\\nthere’s a number we give a guy\\nwho we feel is in the rotation of\\ntop eight as a freshman, and he\\ngraded out at that.”\\n\\nthe coach said being in the\\ntop five and being ready to start\\nis very different, another step\\nup from his current spot in the\\ntop-eight rotation. but with\\nsophomore derrick walton\\njr., junior caris levert and\\nsophomore zak irvin appearing\\nas clear starters, chatman looks\\nto be one of the viable candidates\\nfor the fourth spot, beside a host\\nof big men at the ‘5.’\\n\\nthat doesn’t mean he can’t\\nslide to the ‘2’ or ‘3’ to fill in.\\n\\n“we have guards, we have\\nforwards and we have a guy that\\nplays in the middle,” beilein said\\noct. 2. “sometimes, we’ll have\\nfour of them out there at one time\\nthat are guards. because of kam’s\\nball handling ability, i think he\\ncan play a lot of positions.”\\n\\nfor now, chatman’s skill puts\\nhim in a good spot for playing\\ntime starting with monday’s\\nexhibition against |§ wayne\\nstate. he'll likely be playing in\\nrobinson’s old spot, and he’ll be\\ncompared to him, whether he\\nlikes it or not.\\n\\n“the best coaching staff in america’\\n\\nby minh doan\\ndaily sports writer\\n\\nthe michigan women’s\\nbasketball coaching staff spends\\nso much time together that\\nsometimes, coach kim barnes\\narico jokes they need mandatory\\ntime away from each other.\\n\\n“sometimes we need to say,\\n‘t’m not allowed to see you,’\\nbecause i could show up at\\nchurch and there’s (assistant)\\ncoach (melanie) moore with\\nher family as well,” barnes\\narico said.\\n\\nbut it’s that family-type\\natmosphere barnes arico has\\ntried to cultivate that has created\\nsuccess within the program.\\n\\nwith players coming and\\ngoing every year, the variable\\nthat has remained constant is\\nthe coaching staff.\\n\\nthat’s why michigan was able\\nto get back to the postseason\\nafter losing its core after barnes\\narico’s first year.\\n\\nand that’s why this group\\nof coaches is as barnes arico\\nsaid, “the best coaching staff in\\namerica.”\\n\\n“it’s family here,” moore\\nsaid. “i have two little ones\\nat home, and they’re around\\nthe staff because they’re great\\npeople. they’re all here for one\\ngoal, which is to put michigan\\nwomen’s basketball on the map.\\nwe have each other’s back, and\\nit’s a great atmosphere.”\\n\\noff the basketball court, the\\nstaff spends time together with\\nactivities such as watching\\nfootball games together and\\nsunday dinners at barnes arico’s\\nhouse.\\n\\n“we're with these guys more\\nthan we are with our own\\nfamilies,” moore said. “(barnes\\narico) does an excellent job of\\nmaking sure we have excellent\\nchemistry on our staff.”\\n\\nthe dynamic is a cohesive\\none, too. michigan boasts a\\ncoaching staff that is comprised\\nof only women, with moore and\\nbarnes arico being mothers.\\n\\n“ti think one of the greatest\\nthings about having an_all-\\nwoman staff is that you really\\nunderstand the players,” barnes\\n\\narico said. “and with some of us\\nbeing moms, we understand how\\nthe kids in our program need to\\nbe treated as someone’s child, as\\nwell as how they can be pushed\\nand challenged.”\\n\\nbeyond chemistry and\\ncohesion, two of the three\\nassistant coaches already had\\nexperience coaching with\\nbarnes arico at st. john’s, with\\nassistant coach joy mccorvey\\neven playing for her.\\n\\nmccorvey came to ann\\narbor with barnes arico from\\nst. john’s, where she was\\npart of the staff that broke\\nconnecticut’s 99-game home\\nwinning streak in 2012.\\n\\nshe played under barnes\\narico from 2006-2010 with the\\nred storm, where she was a\\ncaptain and ranked third all-\\ntime in st. john’s history with\\n\\n777 career rebounds.\\n“t think one of the greatest\\nattributes joy has is she\\n\\nunderstands me better than\\nanyone else,” barnes arico\\nsaid. “she really knows the\\nexpectations and the demands\\nt have.”\\n\\nmccorvey, who coaches the\\npost players, was instrumental\\nin senior forward cyesha\\n\\ngoree’s success last season.\\n\\nwhile she is known to be\\ntougher on the players, with just\\nfour years since mccorvey was\\nin college, she has also become\\nsomething ofa big sister to many\\nof the players, including goree.\\n\\nassistant coach megan duffy\\nis in her first season at michigan\\nafter making the move from\\ngeorge washington, where she\\nwas also an assistant. before\\nshe coached the colonials,\\nthough, she coached at st. john’s\\nwith barnes arico, and when a\\nposition opened up at michigan,\\nit was a seamless fit.\\n\\n“when we had an opening, i\\ncalled coach duffy, as kind of\\nset up, and asked her ‘would you\\nrecommend anyone?’ without\\nmentioning her,” barnes arico\\nsaid. “a couple days later,\\n(duffy) called me back and said,\\n‘why didn’t you mention me?’...\\nand the rest is history.”\\n\\nfive years removed from\\nthe wnba, duffy still has the\\nsame competitive drive that got\\nher drafted 31st overall by the\\n\\nminnesota lynx.\\n“coach duffy’s a bit of a\\nperfectionist,” barnes arico\\n\\nsaid. “she checks in with (the\\nplayers) constantly, to make sure\\n\\nour point guards are the best in\\nthe country.”\\n\\nmoore is the only coach on\\nstaff who didn’t know barnes\\narico personally before coming\\nto michigan, but the first time\\nbarnes arico talked to her, she\\nknew moore would be a good fit\\non her staff.\\n\\ncoming from _ princeton,\\nmoore understands the time\\ncommitments of being a student-\\nathlete at an academics-heavy\\nuniversity. this has made her\\ntransition from the ivy league\\nto the big ten easy.\\n\\nmoore, who coaches the\\nguards, is known for her\\nenergetic and positive coaching\\nstyle.\\n\\n“coach moore is_ super\\npositive, she’s ‘p-squared in\\na-squared, positive patty in ann\\narbor,” barnes arico said. “she’s\\nenergetic, she’s encouraging,\\nand the kids love to be around\\nher.”\\n\\nwith such a_ turnaround\\nfrom barnes arico’s first and\\nsecond years, when she lost a\\nfull starting lineup, the program\\ncontinues to make a name for\\nitself in the ncaa.\\n\\nand it’s all due to “the best\\ncoaching staff in america.”\\n\\nluna anna archey/daily\\nmichigan women's basketball coach kim barnes arico has helped assemble a familiar staff to help her teams succeed.\\n\",\n",

once\\ni didn’t have to look for the twinge\\nin my father’s eye as i declined his\\ngrey slacks, button down and trips\\nto church with our grandmoth-\\ner, and in turn ate his eggs on an\\norange ceramic plate, balancing on\\nmy bare knees, curled up in the cor-\\nner of the couch.\\n\\ni watch many of my friends pack\\nup their backpacks at 9 p.m. on\\nsunday nights to leave the library\\nand walk to church service. every\\nweek, parentless, rule-free college\\nstudents prioritize their faith over\\ntheir studies, over their sleep, over\\nan extra hour of late night conver-\\nsation with friends.\\n\\nbut this summer, noise around\\nhomosexuality in the united\\nmethodist church compelled me\\nto return to 10 o’clock service on\\na 90-degree morning, to join indi-\\nviduals who believed our church’s\\nmission statement should change,\\nand propelled me to examine the\\nfinite meaning of how i stand as a\\nmethodist.\\n\\nthe united methodist church\\ntoday is at a crossroads. among\\nall participants, from individuals\\nsitting in the pews, to pastors of\\nchurches, to clergy of the office\\nof the bishop, the discipline is\\nbeing scrutinized and changes are\\nmanifesting in some of the largest,\\n\\nmost tangible ways. the advocacy\\ngroup, reconciling ministries\\nnetwork, is mobilizing united\\nmethodist churches across the\\ncountry to rewrite their mission\\nstatements and be open and affirm-\\ning of all lgbtq persons.\\n\\nreverend frank schaefer, a\\n\\nsesu s on thomosexvali ry\\n\\nunited method-\\nist minister, lost his\\nordination

among hundreds\\nthat lacks fluid consen-\\nsus. some bishops punish\\nclergymen and women who have\\nopenly performed gay marriages\\nwith preventing them to work for a\\nday or a week. other bishops revoke\\ntheir credentials entirely, shaming\\nthem and stripping them of the job\\nthey passionately believe in. the\\ndifferences in their approach to the\\nissue are immense and incoherent.\\n\\nmy church’s motto, “open\\nminds, open hearts, open doors,”\\nwhich had been engrained in every\\npamphlet, sunday school activity\\nand sermon growing up, did not\\nhold true. in ann arbor, i found\\nthat the wesley foundation, a\\nuniversity of michigan campus\\nministry of the united methodist\\nchurch, was worlds ahead of my\\nchurch back home. one evening,\\ni questioned reverend rob roth,\\nthe current chaplain of the wesley\\nfoundation, about how his church\\ntransformed into a rec-\\nonciling one — and as i\\ndid my own resistance\\nto methodism morphed.\\n\\nit didn’t come from\\nthe facts that stood\\nclear in my mind con-\\nfsistently. there are\\nseven major passages in\\nthe bible condemning\\nhomosexuality in some\\n_a‘orm — none of them\\n\\nare jesus speaking, and\\n\\nmore importantly, none\\n\\nof them speak to how\\n\\nwe understand homo-\\n\\nsexuality or bisexuality\\n\\n: * s { ez .\\n\\\\ | ——— 7 ss\\n\\\\ \\\\ ra = as\\n‘ \\\\ i\\n\\nillustrations by megan mulholland\\n\\nin 2014. modern psychology hasn’t\\nrecognized homosexuality as men-\\ntal illness for decades and method-\\nism respects the science of its time.\\nmethodism stays consistent to its\\ninterpretations. if we take leviti-\\ncus 18:22, “thou shalt not lie with\\nmankind, as with womankind: it is\\nabomination,” that would mean we\\nwould need to take every passage,\\nevery sin and punishment, literally.\\n\\nbut where my identity evolved\\nwas where i learned that being\\nmethodist did not mean stand-\\ning with a list of beliefs every one\\nof my fellow methodists believed.\\nissues of homosexuality would not\\nbe on that list, because methodism,\\nunlike so many religions, does not\\nhave a list. we have articles of faith\\nin our discipline that we respect but\\nwe are not a confessional church.\\ninstead, we have a quadrilateral\\nscripture that embodies: scripture,\\ntradition, reason and experience.\\nmethodists, by definition, means\\nthe person sitting next to you in\\nthe pew takes scripture, tradition,\\nreason and experience in any form\\nthey believe. we are not taught or\\ndirected, we are enlightened and\\ngiven the opportunity to interpret.\\nand today, not enough have inter-\\npreted and understood that those\\nseven passages should not keep\\ngays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgen-\\nder or any other humans out of the\\nchurch. we must continue to inter-\\npret so others can continue to stand\\nas methodists.\\n\",\n",
