# Computer-Vision-Capstone-Project

## Overview
The project is designed to showcase the practical application of Python programming skills by integrating various third-party APIs, manipulating images, and applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Project Details
Throughout this course, I worked with several powerful libraries and tools to create a real-world project. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key components:

Third-Party APIs: Learn how to interact with and integrate APIs into your Python projects.
Image Manipulation with Pillow: Explore the Python Imaging Library (Pillow) to modify and enhance images.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Implement OCR using Tesseract and Pytesseract to extract and recognize text from images.

## Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library for image processing.
Tesseract: An open-source OCR engine.
Pytesseract: A Python wrapper for Tesseract.

## Course Information
This project is part of the Python 3 Programming Specialization and represents the culmination of the learning experience. It provides an excellent opportunity to apply the skills learned in a real-world context.
